    "\n",
    "In this section, we summarize the insights gained from sentiment analysis and predictive modeling, and discuss potential next steps and directions for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights:\n",
    "- The sentiment analysis, particularly using **VADER** and **TextBlob**, has shown that sentiment plays a crucial role in predicting stock price movements.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** achieved **94% accuracy** in predicting stock price movements based on sentiment data from Reddit posts.\n",
    "- **Random Forest** models provided comparable accuracy but may be more robust in capturing non-linear relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Directions:\n",
    "1. **Expanding the Dataset**: We can enhance the model by including additional stock symbols (e.g., Tesla, Amazon) and different timeframes to generalize the prediction.\n",
    "2. **Advanced Sentiment Models**: Moving to more advanced sentiment analysis models such as **BERT** or **XLNet** could further improve the sentiment classification accuracy.\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features, such as **technical indicators** (e.g., moving averages, RSI), and market news sentiment could improve the predictive power.\n",
    "4. **Model Deployment**: The model could be deployed using a framework like **Flask** or **Streamlit** for real-time predictions and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By refining this approach, the model could potentially be used in **automated trading systems**, **investment analysis tools**, or for **market forecasting**.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how sentiment analysis extracted from **Reddit posts** can be used to predict stock price movements. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We **scraped Reddit** data for **Apple stock** (AAPL) using **PRAW**.\n",
    "- We performed **sentiment analysis** using **VADER** and **TextBlob**.\n",
    "- The data was integrated with **stock price data** from **yfinance**.\n",
    "- We built a **Logistic Regression** model to predict **stock price movement** with a high **94% accuracy**.\n",
    "- We experimented with **Random Forests** and performed **hyperparameter tuning** to improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps include exploring more advanced models, integrating additional features, and deploying the model for real-time use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like further assistance or have any other questions!\n"
