Portfolio Talk,"Hello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know.

**First, the foundation**

Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.

**Tech Focus**

People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,

Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.

Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.

Alphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice

Apple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way.

Meta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up.

ASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one.

Nvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one.

IonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years.

**Consumer Focus**

Costco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO.

Pets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure.

Procter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY.

Walmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,#

**Finance Focus**

Berkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends.

Intuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially.

JP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue.

MasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO.

PayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO.

S&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever.

**Real Estate Focus**

Realty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY.

VICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion.

I think I have a good mix of sectors and stability/growth. I am not looking for advice but will take onboard any criticism.

Thanks all.",3,1,1733681936.0
"If you had to start again today and could only choose five stocks to set you up for the rest of your life, what would they be?","If you had to start again today and could only choose five stocks to set you up for the rest of your life, what would they be?

Imagine you can't do any day trading or chopping and changing. Just five stocks to set you up for the long term.

The tech and AI ones are obvious, particularly stuff like Amazon, NVIDIA, Microsoft etc. I struggle to think of what would be in my guaranteed top five though.",5,18,1733681856.0
Shorting Tesla,"Tesla went up almost 50% after Trump won elections. Although they are friends, Trump might revoke the EV tax credits. And if not Tesla will most likely be excluded from California's EV tax credits which is the inspiration for 12 other states that may or may not follow California's example.

Further Tesla is becoming less of an exclusive brand and revenue (which hasn't seen real growth the last quarters) is mainly from more discounted cars. Of course Tesla is more than just the cars, but it is their core business..

Do you think lower revenue might tank the stock or will it still be interesting due to the different other businesses or that Elon Musk as a CEO is already enough to keep investors in.",17,184,1733670439.0
Help understanding JBT merger,"I recently inherited a retirement brokerage account, which I've never owned before, so I've been crash course educating myself about it. The vast majority of it is made up of ETFs and mutual funds, with the exception of one lone stock, JBT. John Bean Technologies. Currently own about 21 shares.


From my understanding it's a long term hold stock, and has done rather well. I wasn't really planning on touching it anytime soon, but recently JBT has filed to merge with another company, Marel (the latter merging into JBT from my understanding).

Ratings now list it as very Bearish and Sell, but I'd like to know why and what this kind of merger can mean. 

Still learning about all of this. I know not to take the ratings at face value, but I don't know yet how to spot potential red flags so I don't want to just ignore it.

Appreciate any insight.

SMCI Recovery and loose DD ,"SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. 

After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. 

We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49.

Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. 

Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. 

There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs.

I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March.",24,24,1733619096.0
Is it true most people lost money when they start with investing in stocks? What do I do now? ,"So I am 27, and I have a good job, make 200k in tech remotely and have a lot of free time. Because of this, and wanting to make more money, I wanted to start investing to make passive income. 

I was heavily paying off my debt, and now last month I was left 160k in my HYSA after my debt finally went fully paid and 10k in my checking. 

My expenses are not that crazy, so I decided to move this money in my brokerage, and try my hand in investing as HYSA rates are going down. 

This part 2 weeks have been horrible, as I have lost 30k of my 160k lol. 

I was investing in stocks, but I would come back look at 5 minutes later, and they would drop, and I sell. Maybe I have to work on my ability to hold through drops. But the losses added up. 

I have read places that it’s very common for people to lose money in the market starting out, but is this something recoverable? All I see are gains everywhere, but I continue to struggle. 

What do I do next? ",0,152,1733615671.0
Can Wayfair’s New Loyalty Strategy Drive Growth Along with Inevitable Rate Cuts? ,"First let’s get this out the way, Wayfair did see a 30% jump last month, I think this is moreso in anticipation of lowering rates, as of Q3 this yr Wayfair is still reporting a loss currently, I still think they have room to grow.

We don’t need to dive into this piece too deep, but if rates were to lower from highs which they inevitably will home buying goes up and so too does purchases for furniture. Even if there’s customers that think Wayfair is cheap it’s hard to say that they won’t see growth in revenue. So we know revenue will likely grow, which is great but there’s still a negative bottom line.

Wayfair management recently announced some sort of “loyalty program”. You pay an annual fee and you get discounts (which in a scenario where there’s tariffs that raise prices this might help offset some of those costs to the customer). On a surface level you would think this would hurt bottom lines, but there’s a few catches with this. 

For one, management expects those loyal customers who buy an average of two pieces a year will increase to 3 pieces a year, additionally, with 40% of gross profit being spent on advertising, they think they can cut costs by limiting ads where maybe it doesn’t show to a loyal customer who visits Wayfair anyways when looking for furniture. Lastly it’s a small revenue driver but at $29/year the membership cost is so low where it makes that decision to buy a membership that much easier. 

I like the idea since it seems like it’s trying to tackle an efficiency problem in their spending, and tariff wise could offset SOME of the price increases that may make a customer think twice about a purchase. What’s everyone else’s thoughts? Does this stock have more to drop, and do you think this idea could work?

Best way to establish a short position on MSTR?,"I have strong conviction that MSTR will collapse at some point. It's a speculative bubble based on BTC (another ""asset"" for which I hold low regard, but that's another point entirely). However, I have much less confidence in my ability to predict when this collapse will occur, and I'm aware that the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent. I don't intend for my short position to take more than 1% of my portfolio.

How can I learn more about the best way to short an overpriced security? Right now, it's MSTR, although I'd be interested in the future as well. I'm aware of the following:

* Regular shorting: I'm very hesitant given the possibility of short squeezes with these meme stocks, although I'm trying to calculate how much of this risk is already priced into the other options.
* Put option: Safer, although this is priced into the premium and time decay, which is really expensive for these stocks.
* Inverse daily ETFs: These are simpler to understand on a surface level, although the underlying financial magic that makes them possible is much more complicated. Unfortunately, the only available ones I've found are 2x inverse daily ETFs, which makes this even more volatile and less susceptible to holding longer.

Would it be practical to calculate how expensive these three options are to each other? Or does this require an actual quantitative analyst?",6,55,1733552481.0
Apollo and Workday rally on news they’ll join the S&P 500,">Shares of investment firm Apollo Global Management Inc. and workplace cloud-services platform Workday Inc. rallied after hours on Friday, after S&P Dow Jones Indices said the two companies would join the S&P 500 index later this month.  
>  
>Shares of Apollo gained roughly 6% in extended trading, while Workday shares jumped more than 8%.  
>  
>Their addition to the benchmark large-cap index will take effect before the start of trading on Dec. 23, with the two companies replacing Qorvo Inc. which makes components for mobile devices and other electronics, and engineering-services firm Amentum Holdings Inc. on the S&P 500.  
>  
>In a statement, S&P Dow Jones Indices said the additions to the index “are more representative of the large-cap market space.”  
>  
>Qorvo’s stock was down 1.4% after hours, while Amentum was losing 2%.  
>  
>The addition of Workday, which has a market cap of $69.9 billion, to the S&P 500 follows a wobbly performance for its stock. As of Friday’s close, Workday shares are down 3.5% so far this year. But after the company’s quarterly results last month, some analysts still found things to like.

Decades of Backtesting: Insights That Changed How I Invest,"
Benjamin Graham once said, “Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.” This quote inspired me to design an investment strategy that mirrors the due diligence and rigor of buying a private business. Instead of relying on trends or speculation, I sought to focus on key factors that truly drive long-term value. These include growth per share, creditworthiness, return on invested capital (ROIC), and shareholder payout. By integrating these metrics into a systematic framework, I aimed to build a strategy that’s rooted in solid business fundamentals.

The Composite Growth Strategy

The framework of my Composite Growth Strategy evaluates companies based on eight critical areas that mimic how you might analyze a private business acquisition:

	1.	Growth Per Share
Focuses on per-share growth in sales, free cash flow, operating cash flow, and gross profit to ensure that growth benefits shareholders directly.

	2.	Absolute Growth
Measures overall growth in gross profit, sales, operating cash flow, and free cash flow, emphasizing strong financial performance.

	3.	Creditworthiness
Evaluates financial stability by analyzing metrics like cash relative to short-term debt, debt coverage through cash flow, and interest expense as a percentage of sales.

	4.	Low Dilution
Prioritizes companies that avoid diluting shareholders by controlling the growth of outstanding shares.

	5.	Intangible Monetization
Assesses how effectively a company utilizes intangible assets, such as intellectual property and goodwill, to generate profits and cash flow.

	6.	Retained ROIC Composite
Measures how well a company reinvests profits into its business, ensuring efficient use of capital to create long-term value.

	7.	Raw ROIC Composite
Analyzes profitability relative to invested capital, focusing on returns generated from gross profit, operating cash flow, and operating income.

	8.	Shareholder Payout
Examines how companies reward shareholders through dividends, buybacks, and consistent increases in payout over time.

Backtesting Results

To validate this strategy, I used backtesting software adjusted for look-ahead bias, spanning data from 2001 to the present. Stocks were ranked every four weeks based on the Composite Growth Strategy, with rankings from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest).

The results demonstrated a clear trend:

	•	The top-ranked stocks (quantile 10) achieved an annualized excess return of 4.72% over the benchmark.

	•	Conversely, the lowest-ranked stocks (quantile 1) underperformed by -7.81% annually.

	•	Quantiles in between showed a consistent gradient, with performance improving as rankings increased.

Chart in link below

This illustrates that the metrics used in the Composite Growth Strategy not only identify high-quality businesses but also consistently add value over time.

Final Thoughts

This strategy was born from the idea of treating stock selection with the same rigor as buying a private business. By focusing on fundamental metrics like growth, ROIC, and shareholder payouts, it aims to identify companies that compound value over time.

Pros and cons of this investment strategy?,"I have Roth IRA with 150k in it and like everyone I want to grow it.  I know it is a “meme” stock but I was looking at GME with this strategy.

Because it is a Roth, I don’t have any tax implications between shot term or long term.  

If I buy 5000k shares @$30 and then 
sell the 40c for 16Jan2026 for $9.50, 
I get $47.5k.  This is an immediate 
return of 31.66%.  

If I take that $47.5k and do the same - 
rinse and repeat until I can’t buy 100 shares to sell a call against.  I end up 
with 7200 Shares with my initial investment of $150k.  I also have 72 contracts at the $40 strike.  So essentially I paid 20.83 per share.  

So for my investment to lose money the price would have to drop below $20.83 
which is the risk with this strategy.  On the other side if the price stays flat at $30 and contracts expire worthless.  
My investment is now worth $216k or a 
44% return in just over a year.  If it does go up and shares are called away, then 
my account is now $288k or a 92% 
return in just over a year.  

Even if price drops 20% it would still be a 15% gain on original investment.

Obviously with any investment you risk losing it all.  So two questions.

1. Is my math correct 

And 

2.  Would you do this and why or why not?",0,13,1733504288.0

IOT: A Potential Dip-Buying Opportunity?,"Last night, Samsara Holdings (Ticker: IOT) reported earnings that comfortably beat both EPS and revenue expectations. Despite strong performance, the stock fell over 10% after hours. As the market said: “Cool, but your Q4 guidance is $0.8M shy of what we wanted, so here’s a **10% drop in your stock price** for your troubles.” 

  
**What Does Samsara Do?**  
Samsara provides sensors and cloud-based software to help manage vehicle fleets and industrial operations. Their Internet of Things (IoT) platform enables GPS tracking, monitors routes, assesses vehicle performance, and now includes cutting-edge AI-powered safety features.

**Earnings Highlights:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 36% YoY.
* **Large Customer Expansion:** Increased share of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from large customers ($100k+ ARR contracts).

**So Why the Drop?**  
Apparently, Wall Street got hung up on guidance. Samsara revised its Q4 revenue target to a midpoint of $335M, which is… drumroll… **$0.8M less than analysts expected.**

Yes, the company that just grew revenue by 36% is being punished for rounding down. This modest adjustment led to a **$3 billion market cap wipeout.** 

**Why I’m Still Buying:**

1. **Big Moves Up-Market:** Samsara is snagging bigger clients and expanding internationally, showing they’ve got staying power.
2. **Innovation FTW:** Their AI-powered **Drowsiness Detection** (launched in October) uses **38 billion minutes of video training** to spot tired drivers. Yawning? Head-nodding? Face-rubbing? Samsara knows, and they’ll tell you (and your boss). It’s next-gen safety tech that can save lives and dollars.
3. **Consistently Outperforming:** This is a company that has a habit of beating its own guidance. Personally, I’d bet they’ll do it again.

  
The way I see it, this stock drop is a classic case of Wall Street overreacting to decimal places. If you’re in it for the long haul, Samsara’s story—international expansion, innovative products, and solid execution—remains intact. I am of the opinion that represents a good buy opportunity of a stock I'm a long term fan of, would love to hear others take on the company and if i missed anything!

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

How to perform due diligence when making investment choices?,"I started investing about a year and change ago. For the longest time I just put everything into a S&P mutual fund and forgot about it. While It did do pretty well, I've recently started getting into trading individual stocks. I've had some VERY good plays and some VERY bad plays but overall have made a decent profit. 

Issue here is I've just been getting lucky/unlucky. Not only that, when it's somewhat intentional I find I'm always behind the 8 ball on something. How do people perform their due diligence on a stock/company/investment? How can you look at a news article and make conclusions about a stock from there? Where are you guys even getting this information from? Is this something you have to stay glued to 24/7 to be able to get ahead of the curve and start making reliable gains? 

I feel like i've gotten through my beginners luck phase and want to actually start investing with some strategy moving forward and could just use some guidance on the basics of the research here. ",46,32,1733475688.0
How Long Will You Keep DCA?,"Let's say you are doing DCA for stocks you have high convictions, such as NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, PLTR or RKLB.

And you are doing, say $200 per month or perhaps $500 every quarter (more or less, depending on your financial situations) per stock.

1) At what stage of the stock's life would you then decide to stop DCA? Especially for stocks like MSFT and AAPL that have been around for a long while?

2) Also, while you DCA, would you also sell your initial amount you bought? Or you'd let it ride?

3) What stocks are you guys DCA now?

Gelsinger's push into software and edge computing was 80% of my faith in the Intel LEAPs I'm holding; anyone able to offer some insight?,"Intel was making some interesting moves into software offerings, edge computing, software, and toolkits for AI development since Gelsinger was brought on. Hardly any sites are covering this; pounding the semiconductor drum seems to be what's getting clicks.

Does anyone have more information on public statements for these offerings? I can't find anything amidst the deluge of doom from Gelsinger leaving before his 4 years was up; I'm not looking for speculation on the next CEO, but information on possible paths forward for these less conspicuous arms of their offerings. Honestly, the shebang around CPUs is giving me corn subsidy vibes.

Tesla stock pops as Giga Austin visit has BofA bullish,"“Tesla (TSLA) stock popped Thursday on the back of bullish comments from BofA Securities, with the firm’s analysts fresh off a Giga Austin factory visit.

“The trip gave us increased confidence that TSLA is well-positioned to grow in 2025+ with its core EV business and launch of its robotaxi offering, and longer-term from its investments in Optimus,” lead analyst John Murphy wrote in a note to investors.

Murphy reiterated his Buy rating for Tesla and upped his price target to $400 from $350. Tesla shares jumped 3% in midday trade.”

Which companies will benefit from the EU-Mercosur deal?,"I habve been investing in Brazil since 2020  when I started and hold two positions in Brazilagro (LND) and Gerdau Metallurgy (GGB).  
With eth impending EU-Mercosur deal, I expect agriculture stocks from Mercosur to do well (so Brasilagro). I had an eye on MRRTY, a (mainly) processed chicken copmpany but it has risen a lot this year so I think the big growth is not there. From the EU agriculture stocksm I don't know if any will benefit (maybe Case New Holland as they produce farming vehicles)

Not so sure about Gerdau because I still expect China to dump steel in Brazil. 

Are there any other companies I should look out for, either in Europe or South America that are worth taking a look at?

Vital Farms (VITL) and the Growing Premium Food Market - Analysis of Cultural Shifts and Market Opportunities,"Imo there's a growing convergence of consumer preferences towards high-quality, organic food production that I believe creates an interesting opportunity in stocks like Vital Farms (VITL).

Intapp has an excellent growth story,"I analyzed Intapp, a company that provides “vertical” software for the financial and professional services industries, and although it is not as well known as some of the larger software companies, its stock has performed very well, especially in terms of growth, market opportunity, and financial performance since its IPO. Intapp is stock price has doubled since its IPO and is up more than 60% year-to-date, although the valuation still has a lot of upside

I note that the market for Intapp is services is huge, with a target market (TAM) of $46 billion, and the company currently has a market share of $500 million, which means it has a market share of about 1.1%. The company has demonstrated its strong growth potential by expanding its product portfolio and utilizing a low-code approach, attracting some of the top firms in the financial, legal and accounting industries as clients

Intapp is clients include well-known companies such as Lazard, Carlyle, and EY. The partnership with Microsoft, in particular, has been crucial for the company, as Intapp is software can be purchased directly from the Microsoft Azure marketplace and runs on the Azure platform. Microsoft's sales network also helps raise awareness of Intapp is products

I found that Intapp is annual recurring revenue growth rate was 27% and that the company's net revenue retention rate was 119%, which is much higher than what is common in the industry. The company has been successful in expanding its existing customer spend and further driving revenue growth through new industry expansion

In the most recent quarter, Intapp achieved rapid earnings growth, with its pro-rata operating income increasing by more than 100% and operating margin increasing by 640 basis points year-over-year

Despite Intapp is strong financials, the stock remains relatively well valued. With a current market capitalization of $5.2 billion, it is valued at a multiple of 9.0x EV/FY 2025 revenues and 7.8x EV/FY 2026 revenues based on revenue growth expectations over the next several years

Intapp is a company with strong growth potential, the demand for its products in specific industries has brought it a large number of customers and its partnership with Microsoft has further strengthened its market position. Therefore, I think the investment will be very profitable. Overall, Intapp shows very good risk-reward prospects",11,1,1733426351.0
Is there any stocks/funds that mirror BTC/crypto?,"Im just starting to recently fund my ROTH IRA. At the moment i have it at 80% FXAIX and 20% FTIHX.

Im looking to make this around 10-20% of my portfolio. Do you think this is an ok decision or should i just stick with the funds I have? Any opinions would be appreciated. Thank you!",0,19,1733419625.0

Many stocks still down 50-90% from 2021 highs. ,"Lately I have been sifting through a lot of stocks that reached outrageous highs in 2021 and have since fallen back down to earth, and are now sitting at abysmal lows. In my opinion, some of these companies have been overly sold and seemingly forgotten about. 

Some companies on my list are ROKU, ETSY, RIVN, ZM, MNMD. I am still researching these companies, and may open a position with 1 or 2 of them. These companies revenues are climbing, a couple have PEs in the 30s, and they all have a very strong brand. 

I am not totally sold on any of them, but just finding it wild how that their valuations were once 5X-10X higher just a few years ago, and not all that much has changed business wise. 

Open to some criticism about the stocks I listed. But would really like to hear about stocks that have suffered a similar fate, but in your opinion, is completely unwarranted. 

I think a lot of the aggressive selling off was very warranted and healthy after 2021, but some of it may have been over done. 

Would love to hear your thoughts on this!

Downsides of FEPI,"So I just found out about FEPI, and went into a rabbit hole of info on it. Did some math on it, and it seems very volatile, but at the rate of return that it promises (25-27%), it seems like a no brainer. Even if the market crashes by 50% in 2 years, then recovers back to normal in another 2 years, on an initial investment of 10k, you still come out on top.

  
10,000 initial investment

Year 1: 2,500 DIV Yield

Year 2: 1,250 DIV Yield (assuming 50% drop across all tech stocks)

Year 3: 1,250 DIV Yield

Year 4: 2,500 DIV Yield

  
Total returns of almost 19% per year, even in a recession situation. I understand FEPI sells covered calls against the individual stocks and not against the index, so if the underlying tech stocks crash, it will too, but I'm pretty sure tech stocks will recover eventually through any recession (maybe this is the logic preventing others from doing this?)

  
I assume there's something wrong with my thinking, or else everyone would be putting 100k into this instead of any other index fund and calling it a day. 

  
Can anyone give me some more info? ",11,11,1733363782.0
Meta Announces $10 Billion Data Center in Louisiana,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a)

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

Rivians everywhere I look! ,"I know this is anecdotal, and not a good reason to invest, but I have been seeing Rivians everywhere lately. I decided to do a little digging. 

Rivian's sales were up 71% compared to Q1 2023. The company has been ramping up production, although it has faced some challenges due to supply chain issues. Rivian has adjusted its delivery targets for 2024 to between 50,500 and 52,000 vehicles.

I understand that they have been struggling to make a profit, which definitely cannot be overlooked. But, there is no denying that the demand is there. The backing is also there. Volkswagen has invested in Rivian. In 2024, Volkswagen announced an investment of up to $5 billion in Rivian, with the goal of developing next-generation electric vehicle architecture and software technology. The two companies formed a joint venture to collaborate on this project.

The stock has been sitting in the 10-15 dollar range the last 6 months. It seems to me that the market is waiting for it to break one way or another. If it breaks to the upside I could see a lot of people that have been waiting on the sidelines hop on board. 

This is just my quick two cents on the stock. Would love to hear everyone’s else’s opinion. I decided to throw 100 dollars on it as a fun bet. I’m definitely routing for them. I think their trucks looks really cool, and I love the new cars in the pipeline. 

I’m sure this post will get marked as low effort, but I don’t want to have my post be 5 pages of AI, like every other post.

SCHG vs. SPLG vs. SCHD: Too Much Overlap?,"I’m considering these ETFs for my portfolio: SCHG (growth stocks), SPLG (broad S&P 500), and SCHD (dividend/value focus). I’m worried about overlap—here’s what I’ve found:
	
•	SCHG vs. SPLG: High overlap (~30%-40%) due to shared large-cap growth names like Apple and Microsoft. SPLG is broader but tech-heavy.
	
•	SCHG vs. SCHD: Minimal overlap. SCHG is growth-focused, while SCHD avoids most tech in favor of dividend payers like Pepsi and Coke.
	
•	SPLG vs. SCHD: Moderate overlap; both hold large-cap dividend stocks but differ in sector balance.

What’s your take? Worth holding all three, or are two enough?",3,5,1733345760.0
"Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk","Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.

Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.

Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.

But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.

“They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.”

In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder.

The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.

Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.

Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal.

Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.

“Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.

“Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.”

Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department

Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.

But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.

“I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?”

If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.

“You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.”

While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.

“I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. ""There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.”

Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.

Costco's Extreme PE Ratio,"I have been a long time holder and buyer of Costco's stock, my holdings have preformed considerably well compared with the rest of my portfolio. I was buying Costco stock around 2020-2022 when the PE ratio was around 30-40. Since then the PE has shot up and is quickly approaching 60. The last time Costco had a PE this high was right before the 2000's bubble, it lost 50% of its value over the next couple years. Is Costco still worth buying at a 60 PE ratio? Is Costco doing something different with their business model in 2024 that justifies the PE to almost double from the start of 2024? Are investors starting to get irrational in this market?

I Want to Hear Your Thoughts on the Qualities Intel’s Next CEO Should Have and Why,"With Pat Gelsinger retiring, the company is once again searching for a CEO who can steer it through its challenges.

Who do you think Intel needs next as CEO, and why? Should it be an insider with deep technical expertise or someone from outside with a fresh perspective? How do you think the leadership transition will unfold in the coming months/years?

Here’s a quick summary of Intel’s past CEOs, their departures, and the criticisms they faced, for reference:  


|**CEO**|**Predecessor's Reason for Departure**|**Public Criticism or Perceived Failures**|**Successor’s Key Attributes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Pat Gelsinger**|Bob Swan replaced due to lack of technical background|Struggled to regain process leadership; delays in 7nm; stiff competition from AMD and TSMC|Deep technical expertise, Intel veteran, proven leader at VMware|
|**Bob Swan**|Brian Krzanich resigned after a policy violation|Failed to address manufacturing delays; lacked vision to compete with AMD/ARM-based chips|Stability-focused leader with strong financial acumen|
|**Brian Krzanich**|Paul Otellini retired citing personal reasons|Poor handling of mobile market diversification; failed to anticipate ARM dominance|Manufacturing and operations expertise, Intel insider|
|**Paul Otellini**|Craig Barrett retired as part of a planned transition|Missed opportunities in mobile chips, allowing Qualcomm and ARM to dominate|Strategic thinker, strong marketing and client focus|
|**Craig Barrett**|Andrew Grove stepped down after transforming Intel|Slow diversification beyond PCs; overexposure to dot-com volatility|Deep engineering and manufacturing expertise|

**Questions to consider**:

* What should Intel prioritize in its next CEO: technical skills, operational expertise, or a focus on profitability?
* What qualities or background should this leader have to address Intel's challenges?
* How do you think this transition will impact Intel’s market position and stock performance?

Name a large-cap stock and its small-cap competitor ,"I am always looking for small/mid-cap companies that have a similar business model or product as large cap competitors! 

I’ll start by naming a few (large-cap and small-cap) companies: 

- CRWD and S
- COST and BJ
- KR and SFM
- CMG and CAVA 
- MNST and CELH
- SBUX and BROS 
- Space X and RKLB (count it) 

I always love seeing the small caps slowly take a piece of the pie from the big boys. It’s what capitalism is all about. Especially fun to see when the little guy has a better product. I think this is the case for almost all of the companies I listed. If they aren’t flat out better, they offer something slightly different, or are better in a certain way. 

These smaller cap stocks are obviously a bigger risk, since a lot of them still are not making money, but the growth is very appealing. 

Would love to hear some comparisons like this and an explanation as to why you think the smaller company is better, or will continue to grow.

Costco tariffs coming to a store near you! ,"I love Costco, the stores are awesome and they have everything but i feel the stock has gotten out of control.

The PE is 59! you are paying $59 for every $1 they earn. Thats just irresponsible investing.

They are expanding across Asia but they are also facing stiff competition from home base Chinese companies. And one thing china is very good at: copying everyone else and selling stuff for cheap to eliminate competition. Im not saying Costco will fail but it wont be easy for them outside the US.

Lastly we have the tariff situation. The proposition is a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. This is a bit of a problem because Costco is the #12 importer in the US for 2024. Most common origin is China. Walmart got smart and started to protect themselves and reducing Chinese imports but Costco and their business model, will have a much harder time navigating with keeping the prices attractive.

Costco sells ALOT of electronics and appliances, its one of their biggest categories. If a TV cost $1000 today, staring Jan 20th(day one in office) it will cost $1600. Appliances going up $100's of dollars is hyper inflation and people are already stretched thin going into the holidays.

Im really looking forward to this upcoming earnings release and how they will guide going forward. I guarantee you all the analyst questions will be about tariffs and profit margins.

"""Existencial question"" about common stocks.","Let's suppose that a few financial analysts have evaluated the intrinsic value of the shares of company X. By ""intrinsic"", I mean not only the value of the company underlying assets (tangible and intangible) minus liabilities but also any other type of fundamental analysis. By consensus, the intrinsic value was estimated at $1 per share.

However, the market value is $0.70. In other words, the stock is being sold at a discount. Is there any kind of arbitrage that forces the market price to converge towards the intrinsic value? I haven't yet found any reason that would encourage the increase in the market price beyond the usual speculation. Even if the stock has an intrinsic value of $1, shareholders cannot liquidate it outside the secondary market...

Arbitrage in derivatives markets is easier to understand. Suppose the market price of gold is M. To secure this price in the future, an investor can buy a gold call option at a price P (strike price), where M = P on the date of purchase of the option. After some time, the market price of gold is M+N. Consequently, the option has gained a value of N, that is: it can be sold directly for N to another investor. Even if there is no liquidity in the derivatives market to sell the option for N, the investor can exercise the right to buy gold for P and sell the gold in the spot market for M+N. From this exercise, he would obtain the same N.

In the equity market, I don't see a similar way for an investor to liquidate the intrinsic value of the stock. It doesn't make much sense either. So, there's only speculation left. If that's really the case, it's quite problematic. As a famous economist said: ""Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""",0,18,1733268558.0

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Can someone please explain the process of reclaiming stocks that were escheated?,"Hi guys. If you could please help me out i’d be very grateful. My grandmother passed recently. My father, who was her POA found some stock certificates (old paper ones) for GE ranging from 25-35 years ago.  

She got dementia 3 or 4 years ago and forgot all the details of her life. I was told to have my dad call the share owner services which he did. The only info they would give is that my grandmothers account or stocks are “inactive”.  That’s the only info other than if he wanted more information he has to mail copy of death certificate, POA form , etc. 


If what i found on google is correct , it sounds like the stocks were escheated, but we don’t know the next step from there. She lived in CT and FL, then back to CT after she got sick. 
We just don’t know the process at all. Any info would be very much appreciated. thankyou ",9,10,1733193836.0
What do we think about IOVA?,"Firstly congrats everyone on RKLB, ACHR and LUNR gains. It was fun ride, I have to be honest I had jumped off the wagon a bit earlier but hat off to all of you that mooned! 

Also for some of you that jumped on ZETA, enjoy the good days that await. 

But let’s talk about IOVA…:

Another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer. An industry that is a Holy Grail for all pump and dumpers out here. 

But is this one different? To be honest I do not know, but that is why I am posting this. To hear other sides, other points of view. 

IOVA is currently sitting around $9. These are levels of before the this year run to $16 (what goes up must come down, when pumped and dumped). However… this company reported revenues, 90.86mil revenue to be precise. Granted, not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about. It takes 1 approval and it is too late.

Leadership:
CEO is there since 2016, seems like an experienced guy. Was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved.

Others seem legit as well, this post is already too long… feel free to research yourself.

They also own a bit less than 12% so there is certain commitment there.  And of course the vanguard, black rock etc. are heavily involved as well. More than 87% is owned by institutions. 

Amtagvi product got approved by FDA and that is now generating certain revenue. They plan tk get approval in Canada, Europe and UK as well. 

They also work on LN-145, IOV-4001 and IOV-3001 but let’s be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these.

I know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but I feel like I have to just to make this post a bit more complete.

Potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is 12billion (amount of people with cancer of specific type * cost of treatment) but realistic values at beginning is 1-2bill per year or even less. 

And then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well. 

Company with 90mil revenue and 80 million of debt with 2,8 billion market cap and 440 million of operating expenses. Company with future (on the moon or in the sand). Do you hate IOVA or you will become a bag holder? 

Please share your opinions.",0,18,1733170403.0

Does AVGO is rise count as a gift?,"Since October 2024, Broadcom has underperformed many of its technology peers as investors have rebalanced their allocations to the semiconductor sector.

Despite the recent relative weakness, Broadcom has remained in line with the S&P 500, demonstrating stability.

Broadcom expects AI revenue to reach $12 billion in fiscal 2024, accounting for less than 25% of total revenue.

Custom AI chips are at the core of Broadcom is AI revenues, accounting for up to two-thirds of the total, driven primarily through partnerships with hyperscalers such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google.

Customized chips are expected to play a more important role over the next five years, helping customers address AI cluster scaling and cost challenges.

Broadcom is leadership in the networking market could be challenged by NVIDIA, which is capturing the market with more competitive networking solutions.

Broadcom is growth in AI, while promising, is still a low percentage of overall revenue from AI.

Weakness in the non-AI revenue segment could undermine the market's bullish confidence in Broadcom.

Wall Street is constructive on Broadcom, but future guidance needs to remain strong to maintain market confidence.

Broadcom is forward-looking PEG ratio of 1.69 is attractive compared to the tech sector average of 1.89.

I think attention needs to be paid to the company's execution in AI and potential headwinds in non-AI businesses.

On balance, Broadcom stock is under short-term pressure, but the long-term bullish logic remains in place for investors who are optimistic about AI growth prospects.

Broadcom is long-term growth potential remains with its AI business and custom chip capabilities. I think it needs to be cautious about AI revenue expectations and pay attention to the performance and future guidance of its non-AI business.",5,9,1733153233.0
Anyone else buying the NU dip?,"I’ve been an investor in NU for a while now. I firmly believe the market is panic selling because Warren Buffet sold 19% of his stake in the company.

Today the company is down again because Citi bank downgraded its rating on NU to a sell.

Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets. Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

If anything, the downgrade should be seen as a good sign. It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base.

I know Brazil has made changes to its financial regulations. However, NU is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries. Plus, Brazils projected annual GDP growth per year is very good.

Do you guys agree?

EDIT:

(Thanks for all your thoughts. I’ve realized there are a few key things I overlooked.

I previously thought the stock was heavily owned by retail investors, similar to SoFi’s stock. I naively assumed this because the stock is frequently discussed on social media. Due to this preconceived notion, I believed the stock price would be significantly influenced by analyst ratings. I still think a large number of people have started to sell because of Warren Buffett reducing his stake and Citi’s sell recommendation. However, I now see that the primary factors driving this downturn are geopolitical and economic risks in Brazil.

My updated assessment is that the stock is being sold for a few very valid reasons. Firstly, Brazil’s inflation has been rising over the past few quarters. Secondly, Donald Trump has threatened BRICS nations with 100% tariffs if they decide to create a currency to rival the U.S. dollar. Thirdly, Warren Buffett sold 19% of his stake in the company. Fourthly, the value of Brazil’s currency has been declining and recently hit historic lows compared to the U.S. dollar. Finally, Brazil’s government spending was recently cut, potentially signaling a slowdown in their economy.

Overall, people are very concerned about the economic and geopolitical risks surrounding NU, especially since it is a Brazilian company. Brazil has a historically unstable economy and is currently facing economic headwinds that are amplified by the risk of potential tariffs.

I’m taking a cautious approach from here on out. I won’t be selling any shares, but I also won’t be buying more until the stock price consolidates and the Brazilian economy stabilizes.

I’m still very bullish on NU because the company has grown unbelievably fast in just 11 years. They survived Brazil’s economic collapse in 2014–2016, and they also weathered the last round of U.S. tariffs on Brazil in 2018. I believe NU will continue to expand rapidly into other Latin American countries, which will reduce its exposure to Brazilian tariffs and economic challenges. The CEO and management team are extremely competent, and I believe in their ability to navigate these challenges in the long term.

The worst-case scenario would be if the BRICS nations successfully create a new currency. Even then, I still believe NU will be okay due to its expansion into other markets. For now, I’m holding and remain very bullish on the business.)",30,76,1733151877.0

Is anyone else a little concerned about this market jump up?,"Listen, I get that it seems like clear skies and rainbows, and I’m not really a “bearish” type investor, but sometimes I find it good practice to sit back for a moment and just reevaluate the current situation we’re in.

I’ll give an example that pertains to me. I’m currently invested in Sofi, PLTR, and RKLB, so this has been an incredible year for me. But looking back, it’s starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021. YouTube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and we’re going to be at 500 next year. That’s exactly the type of shit that was said in 2021 right before every small cap stock tanked like 70%. 

I’m not saying it’s a time to sell, I would personally prescribe to the “it’s time to slow down on how much I invest” currently. Buying RKlb at 27$ or PLTR at 66$ is not the same opportunity as in the 4-7$ range as it used to be. It seems very difficult to find any good deals, considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically. And just remember, just it is a great company doesn’t always mean it’s currently a good price to buy it. Sometimes it’s good to take the foot off the breaks when stocks going up 300%+ in one year.

But hey what do I know. Just be careful out there folks, and don’t get sucked too hard into the FOMO. Be fearful when everyone else is greedy and all that jazz.",557,465,1733077454.0

German market - Volkswagen,"I started investing in stock market around 8 years ago and at that time I only did that through my bank in my European country.

So here I am today, checking German market and specifically Volkswagen and I cannot figure out why is it so much undervalued. I mean look at this EBITDA and cash on hand.

Ocean Exploration Stocks! The next big sector! ,"In my opinion, ocean exploration stocks are heavily overlooked. With only about 5% of the ocean explored, there are so many unknowns and promising possibilities. 

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater drones is an emerging technology that I have been keeping a close eye on. This technology will make things like resource exploration, climate change research, scientific research, technological advancements and marine conservation more feasible. The are key factors that will drive growth in this sector the next 5-10 years. 

Currently there are a lot of ocean exploration companies that already have solid revenue streams from oil and gas industries and underwater infrastructure like pipelines and umbilicals. I think these current revenue streams will continue to thrive. And future revenue streams are right around the corner. 

Costs of exploration have been the biggest hurdle in this sector, but as technology continues to advance, costs have been quickly dwindling, making more and more projects feasible. 

Companies that I have recently been researching are: OII and TDY. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts on these companies, and am excited to hear about other companies you find promising in this sector.

The evolution of an investor - Which level are you?,"I believe there’s a common journey (or evaluation) of an investor. We all start by knowing absolutely nothing about analyzing companies or investing in general, but we get better over time, as we accumulate knowledge and experience.

**Level 1: The Noob**

At this level, the focus is solely on the **share price and its past performance**. So, when the share price goes down from $100 to $30, the noob investor would conclude that now, the stock is cheap and buying is the right thing to do. Of course, this doesn’t have to be the case. In fact, public companies that went bankrupt went on exactly this trajectory. There are plenty of reasons why the share price could collapse, and this decline could be justified. However, the noob investor isn’t aware that there are many questions that one should ask.

In addition, at this level, there’s a **tendency to follow the crowd and the opinion of others**, which is often times a really bad idea. However, without any knowledge and experience, the opinions of others oftentimes sound logical and smart.

**Level 2: The Enthusiast**

The enthusiast has heard that **there’s more to investing than just the share price**. You’ve started exploring financial statements, and you’re learning the basics of accounting. **For the first time, the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement start making sense**. I’m sure everyone can recall that time when you could read the financial statements and understand what they meant. It comes with a confidence boost, and it is normal to think “*Ah, I’ve got this investing thing figured out. It’s easy!*”

The catch is – even though it feels like a superpower, this is still the beginning. Financial statements provide information about what happened, not what will happen. Understanding them is useful, but not enough to be a great investor.

But at least now, you can actually challenge some of the opinions of others.

**Level 3: The Seeker**

This is where one is moving beyond the basics. Now you’ve learned that there are **various valuation techniques**, that allow you to figure out what a company is worth. It gets exciting! This is where you get introduced to the EBITDA and P/E multiples, relative valuation, dividend discount model, and DCF. All of these can be powerful tools, and they’re one piece of the puzzle to understand if a company is undervalued or not. At some point, you will likely stick with one or two models that work best for you.

But here’s the problem. Having the tools isn’t the same as knowing how to use them. At this stage, it is common to have fancy spreadsheets with inputs that aren’t supported in any meaningful way other than historical financial data. Basically, **garbage in – garbage out**. You might not be aware of the disadvantages that come with the various models and fall into some of the common traps.

However, it doesn’t feel that way. When you spend hours gathering data and filling in your inputs, **it feels like a new superpower**, because in the end, there is an output. You have estimated the value of a company, and now you can compare that with the market price.

But, if your assumptions about growth rates, the discount rate, or margins are significantly off, your valuation is meaningless. In fact, there’s a chance it harms you more than it helps you.

By the way, everything that I’ve mentioned until now can be 100% automated. So, up until this level, you have no advantage over a relatively simple algorithm.

**Level 4: The Thinker**

At this point, you understand how important the inputs are.

Therefore, the focus shifts a bit more towards **understanding the industry, and the broader environment**, and asking the right questions so that the input is more solid.

For example, if you are analyzing a car company, you might want to understand if there’s a trend regarding EVs, if there are any regulatory changes that will impact your margins, if the company needs to invest more to expand its capacity, etc.

This is when **research becomes your best friend**. You’re no longer just looking at the company in isolation—you’re connecting the dots between the company, its competitors, and the broader environment. Storytelling also becomes a part of your process, as now you’re not just crunching numbers—you’re building a narrative about the company’s future.

**Level 5: The Pro**

This is the pinnacle of investing and where intangibles come into play.

I don’t mean goodwill and patents. I mean **the management team and the company’s culture**. The key questions here are:

* Is the management trustworthy?
* What is its track record?
* What is its vision?
* Is there a culture that can survive tough times?

Culture is an often-overlooked factor in investing, but it’s incredibly important. As the saying goes, 'Culture eats strategy for breakfast.' A company with a strong culture can attract and retain top talent which is a must for being a great company.

What I find interesting is, that if you are to invest in a private company, you’d get to level 5 sooner than if you invest in public companies.

Here’s an example. Imagine someone walks up to you, and offers you to invest $10k in his company, and in exchange, you’ll have 10% of it. The first question that you’ll have is: Who is this person? If the person in question was someone you know for bad behavior, misleading friends and family, and many failed ventures, you probably have your answer already, and the idea is irrelevant.

However, if it was someone you knew who has integrity and many successful ventures, then you’d probably continue the conversation by asking questions about the idea itself. Your goal would be to understand the business, whether it can survive in the environment, and what return can you expect from it.

Technology and its effect on stock market average returns. Does the future hold higher average returns?,"I know, I know.......I know. NO ONE knows what the market will do other than it will go up, down or sideways.

But I feel like we live in a different world now than we did the past numerous decades. Everyone has access to investing. Right in the palm of their hands. Virtually anyone anywhere can invest in any market they wish from their phone. Historical returns are 7 percent (inflation adjusted) based on old technology, processes, access and education on finance. It is no longer the days of old where tie wearing NYSE brokers answer their rotary phones screaming about deals and brokering deals for end user. It was a whole process and really, you NEEDED someone to strike the deals for you and in most cases, suggest what funds to invest in since there was no internet to self educate or even research companies to invest in.

Nowadays with giants like Fidelity, Vanguard and others offering index funds that take all of the thought and most of the choice and a lot of the risk out of the equation. I don't need to ask a broker which SP500 fund to buy. I don't need a broker to strike deals for me. I don't even need to make a call or have a person do ANYTHING for me.

I am not a crypto investor, I am a naysayer in fact. But I cannot deny the effect that crypto has had on investing. It has done a LOT to make investing mainstream, if not even trendy. There were always hedge funds and major investors but now regular consumers are taking part and making retail a MUCH bigger player. Retail tripled almost instantly in 2020 and participation has remained high.

Almost all of the hurdles have been removed between the investor and the investment with technology. There is little to understand/learn and is done anywhere, any time for convenience. Not a fan of robinhood but apps like this have put the keys to investing directly into the end users hands.

Now that investing is automatically diversified, exceptionally well returning index funds are in the palm of everyone's hand, consider that the US stock market is the economic powerhouse of the world. Anyone anywhere for the most part can invest in US stock market. This is appealing to anyone in a lesser financial climate (Japan). Now that the wealth gluttons have their claws in every last corner of US government, I don't see them doing anything but moves to further bolster financial and economic markets. The US stock market is the harvesting field of the elite wealth gluttons.

My personal thoughts though as I said, I am aware NO ONE can predict the stock market. But it feels poised to redefine ""average returns"" and with the near future political climate.....if it doesn't get completely blown up (unlikely) I think future returns will far exceed 7 percent as long as the USA remains the economic powerhouse that it is",19,20,1732898152.0
Thoughts on buying BRB.K this month instead of DCAing into S&P?,"Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRB.K this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into S&P 500?

I usually allocate the same amount of money to S&P 500 every month and have done this for years. However given much the stock market is up (27% YTD), especially including the recent trump mania, I think we are due a pull back.

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently, so does he. However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of S&P, as a one off, hedge against this risk. 

WB has the highest stock pile he’s ever had, whilst still in the market albeit much smaller. I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification - I’ll obviously keep all of my investments in the S&P but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock, so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings. 

Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the S&P this month?

Thanks. ",82,63,1732892041.0
Why I think UBER is a BUY,"**Personal trading context:**

I do not look at balance sheets ever. I invest in companies that are undervalued due to bad publicity and not bad product. This year when CrowdStrike dipped from $390 to $217 I immediately took a position because I knew it was because of panic and not because the company's products are losing inherent value. I did the same for Meta during the whole VR panic and Tesla earlier this year. All of which dipped and are now up by more than 100%. Stock prices are determined by emotional sentiment so analyzing balance sheets are a waste of time to me.

**About Uber:**

I don't know anything about Uber's debts or profits, but I do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other. Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region. Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I'm going to tell you why these things don't even matter.

Recently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You'd assume this will cut into Uber's profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What's crazy is that they're now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\_uber\_2088\_minimum\_pay\_is\_not\_what\_you\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.

**Again, I don't read balance sheets ever. Please do inform me on why it matters and why Uber is NOT A GOOD BUY.**",0,56,1732883538.0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Question about selling and purchase again in less than 30 days Taxes. ,"Hello, I have a question. If I buy 1,000 shares of XYZ at $10 and then sell them for $6, can I use the $4,000 loss for tax purposes
But if the stock continues to fall and before 30 days have passed since I sold it, I buy it again at $4 per share and after a while I sell it at $7??

How count this??? Loss $4000, Gain $3000 = -$1000

What would happen in that case? And if instead of selling it at $7, I hold it longer and end up selling it for more than the $10 I originally paid?

Could Coinbase enter the S&P 500 in the Dec Rebalance? What do you think!,"[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) Global Inc. (COIN) has demonstrated significant growth, meeting several key benchmarks considered by the S&P 500 Index Committee. However, its performance is closely tied to the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. This correlation is evident, as Coinbase's stock price often mirrors Bitcoin's fluctuations. For instance, during bullish Bitcoin trends, Coinbase experiences increased trading volumes and revenues, leading to higher stock valuations. Out off all the likely companies [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is in my top 3 for inclusion this Rebalance.  
  
The forthcoming S&P 500 rebalance will indeed be indicative of the Index Committee's perspective on integrating companies like Coinbase, which are deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency sector. Inclusion of such a company would signal a significant shift towards embracing the evolving financial landscape and acknowledging the growing prominence of digital assets. Conversely, opting not to include Coinbase might suggest a more cautious approach, reflecting concerns about the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties associated with the crypto market. Therefore, the committee's decision will not only impact Coinbase but also serve as a broader statement on the acceptance of digital asset platforms within traditional financial indices.

[TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/fiO01sTb-Dynamic-Relationship-Between-Bitcoin-and-Coinbase/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The S&P 500 Index Committee employs specific criteria for inclusion, such as market capitalisation, liquidity, domicile, public float, and financial viability. While Coinbase may satisfy these quantitative measures, the committee also exercises qualitative judgment, considering factors like market stability and the company's role within its industry.

[Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Given Coinbase's substantial exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market, the committee might deliberate on the potential risks associated with such volatility. The decision to include a company so intertwined with the crypto sector would reflect the committee's stance on the evolving financial landscape and its readiness to integrate digital asset platforms into traditional indices.

In summary, while Coinbase appears to meet the fundamental requirements for S&P 500 inclusion, its strong correlation with Bitcoin introduces considerations that the committee will likely scrutinise, balancing traditional financial principles with the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.",3,39,1732810025.0
I think bird flu risk is being underestimated by the market. Long on $MRNA,"So far H5N1 has been slowly making it’s way from chickens to cows (around the middle of 2024) and now pigs in Oregon (within the last couple weeks). There have been a few mild human cases, basically all in farm workers working closely with infected animals. Although there was at least one case recently where they had no idea where the patient got infected from.

Normally, CDC will be tracking all this and keeping tabs on isolation of infected communities/individuals. This flu seems to be most prevalent in the US than other countries so far, and we have much more transparency and observability than China. So my risk assessment for this has been pretty low until Trump got elected.

But Trump has been making it very very clear that he’s going to pull every stop to deport undocumented migrants. Most of the people working in shitty conditions in farms are…undocumented. Undocumented workers are normally able to access some level of public services like healthcare, but this is about to get completely shut down by the Trump admin. And these farm workers are about to get shoved into concentrated compartments with really poor hygiene conditions, and it’s going to take a long time for them to actually get processed and deported. Many will run and hide, and that will also end up hiding how many people are actually infected and spreading the disease.

I think most people are expecting the Trump admin, especially under RFK Jr.'s health dept, to reduce spending on vaccines. But I think at a certain point, the rhetoric is bound to change, as more and more people get bird flu. After all, Operation Warp Speed was under the last Trump administration as well.

Moderna was given $176 million in July by the HHS to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine. There already exists a bird flu vaccine made by CSL Seqirus, but I would imagine that the Trump administration will want to call upon a well-known American company to manufacture ""America first"" vaccines.

$MRNA has been down for many months, as the COVID hype worn down, but they [recently announced](https://www.biospace.com/business/moderna-slashes-r-d-budget-by-1-1b-eyes-10-approvals-through-2027) that they are reducing R&D expenses and focusing on 10 approvals by 2027.

Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,"[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk)

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",1063,157,1732803922.0
PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential,"PayPal, once a darling of the fintech space, has seen its valuation contract significantly over the past few years. With its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently hovering around 20, the stock is far below its historical average of 43. A return to that average, driven by projected earnings of $5.71 per share by 2025, would imply a stock price north of $246—an opportunity that many investors might be overlooking. But for PayPal to reclaim its historical valuation, much must fall into place.

The foundation of PayPal’s future lies in its strategic initiatives, beginning with the integration of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). Introduced in 2023, PYUSD is more than just another digital currency; it is PayPal’s bridge to the future of blockchain-powered commerce. Unlike many failed stablecoin experiments, PYUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits and Treasuries, giving it the stability and trustworthiness needed to thrive. The potential for PYUSD to facilitate global cross-border payments and power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications is immense. PayPal’s ability to capitalize on this innovation could redefine its relevance in the financial ecosystem.

Beyond cryptocurrency, PayPal is making waves with a growing advertising business that has largely flown under the radar. By leveraging its immense trove of transactional data from over 400 million active users, the company is building a platform that allows merchants to create highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns. This advertising arm, though still in its early stages, has the potential to generate billions in annual revenue. Even modest success here could have a significant impact on PayPal’s top line, creating another compelling growth driver.

Innovation has always been at the heart of PayPal’s strategy, and recent developments like the Fastlane checkout system showcase its commitment to staying ahead. This one-click guest checkout feature, paired with partnerships with major platforms like Shopify and Fiserv, enhances the company’s offerings for merchants and consumers alike. Meanwhile, initiatives like the CashPass rewards program deepen user engagement and loyalty, ensuring that PayPal remains a go-to solution for everyday transactions.

Leadership will play a critical role in PayPal’s resurgence, and newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss appears well-suited for the task. With a proven track record at Intuit, Chriss has demonstrated his ability to foster innovation and deliver results. His focus on empowering small businesses aligns perfectly with PayPal’s strengths and provides a roadmap for future growth.

But the journey back to a P/E of 43 will require more than just strategic initiatives and innovation. PayPal needs to rebuild investor confidence. The company must consistently deliver strong earnings, improve operational efficiencies, and effectively communicate its vision to the market. Transparent updates on key growth areas—such as PYUSD adoption, advertising revenue, and merchant partnerships—will be crucial in shaping the market’s perception of PayPal’s potential.

A return to PayPal’s historical valuation isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the story the company tells and the trust it rebuilds with investors. If PayPal can execute on its strategy, the potential reward is not just a higher stock price but a reaffirmation of its position as a leader in the fintech space. For those willing to look beyond the current market sentiment, PayPal’s path to $246 offers a compelling narrative of transformation, growth, and untapped opportunity.

TL;DR: PayPal is undervalued at a P/E of 20 compared to its historical average of 43. To return to its peak valuation, it must capitalize on its stablecoin (PYUSD), grow its new advertising business, and leverage innovative products like Fastlane Checkout. Under CEO Alex Chriss, with strategic execution and strong earnings, PayPal could see a stock price of $246 by 2025, reaffirming its leadership in fintech.

Looking for advice: combining technical analysis with news-based and high-volatility trading,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been trading more actively lately, focusing on high-volatility stocks and news-based opportunities. This year has been very successful for me. I’ve managed to achieve returns that were even above the S&P 500, so I’m really happy with my progress.

That said, I’m always looking to improve, and I’m wondering if integrating technical analysis into my approach could help me refine my strategy further. I usually hold my positions for a few days to a few weeks. I have a few questions:
	
1.	Which technical indicators would you recommend for someone trading on a short to medium term basis and reacting to news-driven moves?
	
2.	Are there specific timeframes or chart setups that work better for trades lasting days or weeks? 
	
3.	Are there any books, courses, or resources you’d recommend for learning technical analysis, especially for high-volatility setups?
	
4.	How do you handle risk management when trading in such volatile environments?

5.   How can I identify which stocks are likely to have the highest trading volume or volatility during the day ?

I know there’s no one size fits all solution, but I believe combining fundamental insights with technical analysis could help me make better informed decisions.


Thanks in advance to anyone who shares their experience or advice!

Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,"**1.0 Introduction**

Let’s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a **timber-trading company**.

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.

As I’m writing this, its share price is **down over 70%** from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  
**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**

***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***

The company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by **acquiring** many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.

***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***

In 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:

* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)
* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)
* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)
* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)
* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of **Gucci Group,** 100% of **Boucheron,** and 100% of **Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.

François-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes:

* High-end clothing
* Footwear
* Handbags and leather goods
* Sunglasses and eyewear
* Scarves & other fashion accessories
* Jewelry
* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)
* Cosmetics (in early stage)
* Watches

It is also geographically diversified:

* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue
* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue
* **North America**: 23% of revenue
* **Japan**: 8% of revenue
* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue

**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Its revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. 

Kering’s gross margin is stable at \~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.

However, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.

**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**

When there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.

Scaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.

The company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.

||all numbers in €m|
|:-|:-|
|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|
|Operating cash flow|€21.541|
|Capex|(€7.772)|
|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|
|Debt|€4.887|
|Share buyback|(€2.034)|
|Dividends|(€8.229)|
|Other|€25|
|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|

Between 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated **over €21.5 billion** in operating cash flow, or **a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**

Close to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:

1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.
2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from **€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.



**4.0 What can be expected?**

Based on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:

* Organic growth;
* Shareholder return; and
* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.

All of it, while having a **healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:

1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company **with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of **acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**
2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024).
3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).

**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**

  
**5.0 Dividends**

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \~6%.

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.

  
**6.0 High employee turnover**

At the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were **13,403** new hires, and **11,275** employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.

This sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.

In theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).

In addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.

Given the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.

  
**7.0 The concerns**

**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**

Back in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.

In addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.

**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**

In April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.

  
**8.0 Valuation** 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:

* **Revenue** \- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.
* **Operating margin** \- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.

Based on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \~9%), the fair value of the company is **€27 billion (€220/share)** which is very close to the current price of **€224/share**.

This offers an IRR of \~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.

  
**8.1 The Bull Case**

Those who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:

* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;
* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;
* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;
* Positive macro tailwinds;

* Utilizing pricing power;
* Integration of recent acquisitions;
* Reducing operating costs;

**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**



**8.2 The Bear Case**

Those who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:

* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;
* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;
* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;
* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;
* Negative macro tailwinds;
* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;
* Supply chain issues;
* Competitive pressure;
* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities

**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**

Opinions on ZETA?,"
I have watched this stock for some time and it is super interesting.

• Culper research shorts ZETA and publishes findings on some misconducts from ZETA.

• Shares drop big time

• ZETA responds to all claims from culper and
""proves"" them as lies. One of examples is that Culper mentiones EY as ZETA's auditor but EY was never ZETA's auditor. It was always Deloitte...

• ZETA insiders buy large amount of shares as another sign to support the company and that Culper research is lying and playing dirty.

• Shares bounce back a bit.

• Former Louisiana attorney general leads class action suit against ZETA (another dirty move to stop a bounce back or honestly concerned ex politician?).

• Shares drop this week again.

Isn't it crazy how few people can destroy a company for personal interest using deception and dirty tricks? Or is the company the one that is corrupt?

In my opinion Culper clearly lied on many things as a strategy for their short positions, history showed that companies that were shorted by Culper did just fine in the future. Is this case the same?

What is your opinion on this? Is it good entry point, is it too risky to enter.

Btw fundamentals of this company are good.
Healthy growth, nice debt ratio and management, strong institutional ownership etc.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Ganja Bear Case (and one possible exception),"I think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity (with one exception) and almost no one knows why, because the precise nature of how THC as a drug operates isn't well understood by people who aren't both habitual consumers \*and\* up-to-date with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so.

It's the following issue: Let's say it's 2010 when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and I want to get high, I light up a single (1) joint with my friend, we smoke for 20 minutes, and then we're giggling. We go to buy some twice a month or so. A few years later it's been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space. Growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing, everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds, to draw customers to them, get market share and so on. ""Buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as 10x that amount of the neighboring place's stuff.""

This is a race to the bottom. Soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff, but you need \*far less\* of it to get the same high. Habitual users spend less than 10% of what they used to on weed now, everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition. In addition you now have hash oil, edibles, dab pens, tinctures, you name it. Not just regular flower.

I never smoked much anyway, but in the rare case I want a mini-vacation now, I can take a vial of Tincture and put \*one drop\* under my tongue. Within two hours the world is spinning. It's so strong I never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month. A single bottle of this costs about $65, and it comfortably lasts me an entire year. This is a disaster for the industry because I almost never need to give them business. It's so strong that I rarely need to make a purchase at all. And no need for all the paraphernalia with it either. No vapes, pipes, lighters etc. The bottle comes with an eyedropper. Even if I use it often and develop a high tolerance, I still rarely need to go out for more. My friend and I have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for 1/100th the price we can get the same high now, assuming one of us has a tincture (or dab vape pen, or edible, or a newly exotic and potent strain) at home.

Compare this with alcohol, where you can't make, say, vodka much stronger than it is. It's impossible for me to come up with a 10x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because it's physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than \~97% (I think), and vodka is already around 45% and can't reasonably go much higher (taste etc). Also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks, beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc.

Or cigarettes, where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant Zyn use, the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery. You can't just get a year's supply of nicotine in a bottle because (first of all it'd be fatal with a slight dosage error) you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every 2-4 hours regardless of how much you're used to consuming, assuming you're dependent on it to begin with of course. And so it is a consistent business for sellers. This is most true of cigarettes, but also applies to vapes and pouches, which have similarly excellent profit margins. All of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly. Regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product.

It is a subscription model, in short, while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone (a very heavy user to boot) has to go out and buy some, and how much they spend. Alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that I can go into elsewhere, but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot.

The only exception to this? Turning Point Brands (TPB) stock, because they don't sell weed. They sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it. Which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff. Actual weed sellers do not, because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased THC concentration in the products. You can't sell 1/10th as much paper to people for the same effect, or at least it's less affected by this issue. The company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something. Not sure how that'll work out. Keep in mind this is a small cap company, less than $1 billion in market cap, reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector. But it's one small and thriving business I can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely. Not sure how much more it can grow, it's probably overvalued now, but in the past year or so it's risen strongly.

Otherwise? Cronos and other weed stocks? Bunk. For the birds. There might be an exception for medical marijuana (CBD) companies but that's pure conjecture as far as I know. You can make condensed CBD products just the same.",0,6,1732528321.0
Stock events this week,"Hello, I was wondering which event is bigger in terms of stock market volatility. Is it the FOMC minute on Tuesday (Nov.26) or PCE data on Wednesday (Nov.27)?

MDA Space blowing up by year’s end (contract incoming),"All this hype with RKLB, LUNR, and RDW and no-one is mentioning MDA (mktcap - 3.2b CAD). Yeah I know it mainly trades on Toronto but just get a broker that supports Toronto, eg IBKR. They’re planning to list on US soon but by then it will probably already have taken off...

Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.

Still not convinced? Consider:

\> MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.

\>Planet labs is currently generating about 200million in revenue per year. MDA’s geointelligence segment is also generating about 200million in revenue per year. However, MDA’s geo segment represents **only about 20%** of MDA’s total revenue. PL’s marketcap is currently almost **1B**. MDA is 3.1 CAD = **2.2B USD**. Oh, and PL is currently operating at a loss (though that might change next report) but MDA is running a profit. Based on this fact alone, MDA’s mkt cap should be at least double than what it is.

Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.

|""Chrome"" as a stand-alone listed company like Opera browser.|Possibly the worst move. Average user unlikely to install a browser-only app, than stick with factory default browser on the device. ||

Google stock thoughts ," think that google depends on Apple , if apple products fail, or if apple partner with another search engine then Google would fail

Edge and Bing are really good now , comes installed in 80% of the machines sold , if its good enough why bother downloading chrome ? and Bing looks almost exactly the same as google , 

Chrome Os is failing also, Android might get antitrust..

Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie? 

Unfortunately, I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small / mid cap mutual funds in December 2020. Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there, but everything about the fund (historical build up, Morningstar ratings, length of existence of the fund, recommendations by publications, YoY performance,  etc) led me to believe it was a reasonable, if somewhat more aggressive, investment.  

It was all well and good for about a year, as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy.   Articles like [this in the mainstream press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-stock-picks-for-the-post-pandemic-nesting-economy-from-a-five-star-money-manager-11636995166?mod=bnbh_mwarticle) lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism. 

And then it did a capital gains distribution (historically very normal for this fund) in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet.  Like, overnight, lost $15/share.  Similarly, it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating.  It continued to fall from there. 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people.  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term.  Since then....no. 

  
Earlier this year, Delaware merged a couple of their funds, so DFDIX became IYMIX.   As far as I can tell, the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held.   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year, the growths of this fund have been glacial.   I realize that the holdings are small / mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates, but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost. 

I've literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me.  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways, but actually halving of value?  That's never happened before. 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small / midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive? 

  
I'm a little heartsick at the thought of just cutting losses and investing in Vanguard or something but it's been really stressful.  

Thanks in advance.  (And yes, I realize I should have been using trailing stops, but didn't, so no lectures there, please.)",11,9,1732381515.0

Games Workshop up 15% following higher than expected quarterly sales!,"A few months ago I posted about Games Workshop and why I thought it was undervalued.  
TLDR: the new Space Marine II game was a hit and this would drive increased sales.

Today GW announced significantly higher-than-expected quarterly sales, resulting in a 15% bump in stock price.

Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013.  This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm – he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn’t in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow. Am I wrong? What do you think? I am new in the stock market so maybe I am missing something.",0,13,1732310301.0
"After being wrong about MBLY, BOFA doubles down: ""BofA Securities Trims Mobileye Global Price Target to $12 From $13""","Max pain for options on MBLY is misleading when we have over 20% of the float shorted and underwater, the smart ones closed when it was sold off, and then some trading professionals such as BOFA securities/their-friends/people-who listen-to-them, likely opened new shorts at the bottom and tried convincing others to follow their lead.

Then as we would usually see analysts revise their predictions after the market moves (especially if they called it wrong), to make it seem they are smart or something, BOFA securities revised their predictions, to be even more wrong, showing that they are doubling down on their/people-who-listen-to-theirtrading-advice shorts and are willing to be in denial on a stock even if the market decides they are wrong.

Its not the end of the world to have entrenched shorts, since at the end of the day their losses are unlimited, and when they do close its more capital injected, the longer they waited.

Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

Thoughts and dilemma on Rocket Lab? ,"I went into Rocket Lab back in July with the intention of making it my primary long-term growth stock and since then have managed to acquire 440 shares at average price of around $9.  

My intention was/is to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years, because I truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and I believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the US. (I am not american btw)

Just before the election I was in profit in the low thousands, which was nice but since the election I am now sitting at a profit of 147%, which is my best position in my investing ""career"" so far. 

Like I said, I believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power. However, given the fast rise since the election I am expecting correction happening soon. 

And my dilemma is: should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction? Or should I just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then?

What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"I have been a long term investor in MSTR, in fact buying  my position Pre-split.  
My thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into Bitcoin.  Even though I have BTC as a holding in my crypto, I was more after exposure in an equity portfolio.

To cut a long story short, I bought it when it was no mainstream and no ETF's were existing.

I must admit, I sat on a loss for about one year in MSTR.  Buying at $48.10 (split adjusted), and for the longest time sitting at the $25-$30 range, BTC was consolidating and I was fine with that.

If people understand what MSTR are doing, this playbook with bonds and hedging BTC was already in play for a long time, I was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early.  The difference being now that BTC is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well, the eyes on MSTR has multiplied exponentially .

Fast forward one year, and and the FOMO crowd arrived, and with that volatility.

Here is what I learnt when the FOMO arrived:

1. The stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation.
2. Valuations do not matter anymore.  The premium on BTC was as low as 1.5 less than one year go, reaching a peak earlier this week at 3.5
3. The stock goes up like crazy, and comes down like crazy, and when this happens, it's time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control.
4. There is so much manipulation (e.g. the citron report, Social media, Mainstream coverage), on what... a damn tweet!  it is not really easy to understand how this will move, so at this point it is just gambling.

I held my position up to the $543 level, and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the $500 level.  So after 1.5 years, I am out of the MSTR trade.

The lesson I learnt is when the crowds arrive, turn round and walk away.

I still believe in the MSTR playbook, but will only come back when I am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when I am in a bidding war with gamblers.",515,174,1732271709.0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Anyway, After spoke with one my friends, who works as a data scientists in BlackRock  focusing on analyze Biotech and Pharma. She told me the institutions don't really model Chinese market since these Pharma companies don't get much profit. She said the main reason is that, China leveraging its role as a ""developing country"" and medicine to developing countries should be cheap enough as part of humanitarianism.

How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",0,29,1732236473.0

The Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Positions: GOOG: 6 shares OPRA: 100 shares

  
**TLDR**: Opera (OPRA) and GOOG (Alphabet) look like great buys right now.",0,17,1732213520.0
Nvidia Options Action 11/21: Confusion,"So I have 3 Nvidia calls: 160 11/29, 150 11/29, and 150 1/17/25. P/L on the three is about even and got the 160 a few days ago on a dip trying to make a few bucks betting on earnings driving the price up. As we all saw they crushed earnings and the stock moved up a few points.

What im confused about is the value of my contracts dropped pretty significantly at open although the stock was up. Ive been trading options here and there for the past couple years and seen some “odd” action before but nothing like that. Seems completely opposite what youd expect, can some explain why that happened? Not particularly pressed, a little disappointed cuz i wanted to sell the 160 at open but just confused.",0,9,1732200336.0
Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"Let me preface this by saying I live in Europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to US markets due to higher historical returns.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

So finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the American markets for European ones or actively increasing their allocation, if so would love to know the rationale. And more importantly any particular industries or geographies that you’re targeting? ",42,147,1732197702.0
"Palo Alto Networks beats Q1 estimates, shares fall as billings decline.

*For the quarter ended October 31, Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 versus the consensus estimate of $1.47. Revenue totaled $2.14B versus the estimate of $2.12B.*

*For the quarter in progress, Palo Alto Networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.54 to $1.56, with a mid-point that matches the estimate. Its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from $2.22B to $2.25B, which represents 13% growth year over year. The mid-point of $2.235B comes in just above the estimate of $2.23B.*   

*Second quarter Next-Generation Security ARR is expected to range from $4.7B to $4.75B, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 20%.*

*Total revenue for fiscal year 2025, which runs from August 2024 through July 2025, is expected to range from $9.12B to $9.17B. This would represent 14% growth year over year.* 

*""Our platformization progress continued in Q1, driving strong financial results,"" said Dipak Golechha, chief financial officer of Palo Alto Networks. ""As a result, we are raising our NGS ARR, revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year.""*

*The board of directors also approved a two-for-one stock split, which will increase the number of authorized common shares from 1B to 2B. Trading on a split-adjusted basis is expected to begin on Dec. 16, 2024.*

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one. A lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth, I think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels. I'm not in cybersecurity so I'm not sure the likelihood of that, but I'd keep an eye on it. I've made several posts about PANW over the last year and my consensus is I will continue to buy monthly and if there's a large pull back down to <350 I'll look to make a large purchase with cash reserves.",61,11,1732197326.0

Class action lawsuits have been raised against ASML - is it frivolous?,"Firstly, apologies for my English, it's not my first language.

My stock broker have sent me several notifications regarding class action lawsuits being levied against ASML after the last earnings report. The following are the ones I am aware of:

**11/20 - Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman LLC.**  
The complaint alleges ASML misrepresentet or failed to disclose that: (1) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than ASML had indicated to investors, (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than Defendants had publicy acknowledged; (3) ASML had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth, while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology.

**11/20 - Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP.**

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operation and prospects

**11/19 - Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.**

**11/19 - The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz**

**11/19 - Law Offices of Howard G. Smith**

**11/19 - Rosen Law Firm**

**11/19 - Pomerantz Law Firm**

**11/19 - Schall Law Firm**

**11/19 - Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman**

Have also done the same with similar allegations raised against ASML. Now, it seemed to me after the earnings report that while it was not exactly a good one, I've never really assumed there was any misleading being done. Sometimes you raise guidance, sometimes you lower guidance. 

  
I assume my broker have an obligation to notify me of all of these class action lawsuits, but I've not really seen any discussion about them on any on the forums or news sites I follow, which makes me suspect this perhaps is not such a big deal? I am however not very knowledgeable on American law regarding these kinds of lawsuits.

What is your opinion? Have there been any misdirection from ASML or is this frivolous? Even so, could this affect the stock price in the near term?",30,16,1732175473.0
Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"India’s Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

These charges do not change the “strong underlying fundamentals” of India’s market or the country’s growth trajectory, said Raymond James’ head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton. 

“Once the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,” he said.

Trading SPY for gains,"First time posting, long time lurking.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

$8k is the only around 10% of my liquid investment (not counting 401k, etc).

Okta - my analysis and thoughts,"I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12–15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Complements Slack and Salesforce’s SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.



Acquirer: Cisco

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Aligns with Cisco’s cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta’s NOLs can be applied against Cisco’s strong operating profits.



**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**



Acquisition Valuation

2024: $16–18 billion (20–40% premium).

2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.

"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

"Exciting times for space, nuclear and quantum computing stocks!","Space, nuclear and quantum computing stocks are ripping and roaring. There are lot of small to mid cap companies in these industries that could one day be mega cap companies - picking the correct ones is the hard part. 

Would love to hear everyone’s favorite companies in these three sectors, supported by a little explanation as to why you think they have a bright future. 

I am particularly excited about these three industries because I believe the number of satellites in orbit will grow significantly in the next 10 years. I am optimistic that SMR nuclear reactors are going to become mainstream in the coming years. And I believe quantum computing is finally here, and real world applications are popping up every day. 

My personal picks for these three categories are RDW, OKLO and IONQ. Let me know if you agree with these picks or think there are better options. I have a small stake in all three.

Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

My Due Diligence / Research for McDonald's Corporation (MCD)



**1. Fundamental Analysis:**

**a) Valuation:**

\- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Currently at 25.5x, which is higher than the industry average of 23.2x, suggesting potential overvaluation.

\- Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: At 8.2x, significantly higher than the industry average of 3.1x, indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales.



**b) Revenue Growth:**

\- McDonald's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent years, with a 5-year average growth rate of just 0.8%.

\- The company faces increasing competition from fast-casual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices.



**c) Margin Pressure:**

\- Rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on McDonald's profit margins.

\- The company's operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years, suggesting limited ability to improve profitability.



**d) Debt Levels:**

\- McDonald's has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.17, which is significantly above the industry average of 1.2.

\- This high leverage increases the company's financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.



**e) Market Saturation:**

\- McDonald's has limited room for expansion in developed markets, where it already has a significant presence.

\- Growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences.



**2. Technical Analysis:**

**a) Trend Analysis:**

\- The stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period, potentially setting up for a reversal.

\- The 50-day moving average is showing signs of flattening, which could indicate a loss of momentum.



**b) Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

\- The RSI is currently near overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.



**c) Volume Analysis:**

\- Recent trading volume has been below average, indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend.



**d) Support and Resistance:**

\- The stock is approaching a significant resistance level, which could act as a ceiling for further price appreciation.



**Conclusion:**



There are several factors  mentioned above, that suggest McDonald's stock (MCD) could be a potential short candidate:



1. The stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics.

2. The company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion.

3. High debt levels increase financial risk.

4. Limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets.

5. Technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum.



However, it's important to note that McDonald's is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. Short positions carry inherent risks, and any trading decision should be made in the context of a well-diversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance.

My research and direction of ABNB,"Hi Everyone,

Putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me.

I am from the tech industry with a major in data modelling and have spent the last 15 years of my time trading, investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends. Some picks bombed rightaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money, a very small portion were really good wins  but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green.

So based on their push( and possibly for my validation too), I have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it. Either way, this would help me make it better everytime. Also I trade as well as invest a lot via options, so at any point of time, I might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks I reseach.

I am based out of Melbourne, Australia and use IBKR and TastyTrade for trading in US markets.

I do technical analysis too but to be honest I do not rely on technical indicators much but rather  I rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me. Whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued or worth its current evalation. None of the companies that I pick to trade(go long/short) are a quick trades. Usually my trades bear fruit in 3 to 4 months or sometime much longer. Hence I use the options way. No complex options techniques but just a simple call/put to enter with low capital and stay in longer than I could afford if I had gone the cash way.

I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation.

Based on my  analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term.

As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below.

As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov).

**Financial and Fundamental Analysis:**

**1. Valuation Concerns:**  
Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

**2. Slowing Growth:**  
While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions.

**3. Regulatory Headwinds:**  
Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets.

**4. Increasing Competition:**  
The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position.

**5. Macroeconomic Uncertainties:**  
The travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions. With concerns about inflation, potential recession, and geopolitical tensions, consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease, negatively impacting Airbnb's bookings and revenue.

**6. Profitability Concerns:**  
While Airbnb has recently achieved profitability, its margins remain thin. The company's efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term.

**Technical Analysis:**

**1. Bearish Trend:**  
The stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in February 2021, forming lower highs and lower lows. This suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum.

**2. Moving Average Crossover:**  
The 50-day moving average has recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming a ""death cross."" This bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price.

**3. Resistance Levels:**  
ABNB stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels, indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices.

**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  
The RSI has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the 60 level in recent months, suggesting weakness in buying momentum.

**5. Volume Analysis:**  
Recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume, while sell-offs have seen higher volume. This pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant.

**Risks to Short Thesis:**

**1. Innovation and New Revenue Streams:**  
Airbnb's continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment.

**2. Travel Industry Recovery:**  
A stronger-than-expected rebound in global travel could boost Airbnb's bookings and revenue, potentially leading to positive earnings surprises.

**3. Margin Improvement:**  
If Airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through cost-cutting measures or increased efficiency, it could lead to better-than-expected profitability.

**Conclusion:**  
While Airbnb remains a leader in the short-term rental market with a strong brand and global presence, the combination of stretched valuation, slowing growth, regulatory challenges, and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk. I would be initiating a short position in ABNB stock using either a March or April 2025 PUT option, with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis.

Note: This analysis is based on publicly available information and market conditions as of the report date. Please conduct your own due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Don't blame me if you end up losing money on this ABNB short :)",77,29,1731887692.0
Most Efficient Way to Track Public Trades?,"Hey everyone,

I'm trying to find a good **FREE** resource to track public trades, but I'm running into some issues.

I also tried the **EDGAR system**, but for Elon, I could only find 3-4 trades. Again, I couldn't find anything at all on Pelosi.

I understand Palantir has a lot of positive momentum from AI hype, expected defense spending under Trump, and general recovery of growth stocks as interest rates fall from their highs. These are all valid reasons to expect continued success from Palantir, but are investors irrationally exuberant?

Lets talk pharma stocks,"If your not aware the entire sector has been selling off on the appointment of RFK jr for secretary of Health and Human services. Although he was nominated he still has to get approved by the senate, and the senate has big pharma supporting them. So whether he actually gets the position is to be determined.

Second if he does take the position its not going to stop or delay any current R&D, if anything it may speed up the approval process making it more efficient with less bureaucracy. People need to understand drugs and vaccines are a global business not just the US. Europe, South America and Asia have their own FDA and approve US drugs and vaccines.

Third, what matters more is who the president elect appoints for FDA commissioner. Much like the SEC has a head the FDA does too. RFK will focus on fruit loops and the FDA will focus on pharma and their business because, he doesn't have a medical degree and will quickly realize he's out of his element.

The whole sector is way oversold due to fear. Same fear that tariffs will destroy the economy.

PENN - Anybody seeing this? Weekly crossed the 50-Day for first time in 3 years...,"The 8- and 21-day MA's just crossed over the 50-day on the weekly chart for the first time since 2021. This seems like a significant milestone for a stock that has been beaten down since it's failure with Barstool during the meme-stock craze.

You can see my other posts for a more in-depth thesis, but some recent news worth mentioning plus a conspiracy theory:

* Stock is up 30% in the past 6 months, yet \~15% short interest of float. 
* Q3 EPS beat, Rev didn't. Lower promo expenses. Lower losses in OSB than expected. Market share not where we want, but path to profitability is improving.
* Former Disney CTO joined the company. As a reminder, Disney owns ESPN so I see this as more buy-in from the Disney team. 
* Greenlight Capital increased their stake, it is now their 6th largest holding. Einhorn said ""we believe the market ascribes a substantial negative value to \[their OSB business\]"". And thinks OSB could add $20 per share of value.
* ESPN --- ESPN Bet account linking allows the app to know your favorite sports and fantasy team so it can create personalized bets/marketing for users. Shows further integration with Disney.
* Finally launched in NYC, mixed results for now. 
* Multiple analysts initiate coverage, showing it is a player worth tracking. Mixed opinions.

One big deal that no one talks about here is that Disney currently has $500M in warrants to purchase PENN stock. If I remember correctly, their agreement was for 3 years; if Disney doesn't like ESPN Bet's performance then they can pull the plug. Well we just crossed Year 1 and Disney's CTO has now joined PENN, they're linking ESPN accounts, they're seeing fewer losses than expected, and by 2026 (year 3) PENN believes they will have ""meaningful free cash flow"" from OSB. I have a very hard time believing that Disney would rather go through the headache of ripping out all of their integrations with PENN to find a new provider. Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app. 

Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?

Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?

Yeah I don't see that lasting, so I'll buy more. Would love to hear your thoughts.",33,4,1731720151.0

Can someone help me with my evaluation of a stock? ,"I never post, so i don't know how to refer to a thread, but i posted this in r/investing_discussion but without any succes.

So i have been trying to calculate companies i find interesting by dividing Total assets by Free Cash Flow. When i do this for the average company within the S&P500 i get insane values. Take PayPal for example. With a Total asset value of $82 Billion and divide it by $4.2 Billion in free cash flow = 19,5 years before you as the company owner earned it all back. that is close enough to the historical average, not too shabby.

However, when i do this for Wise PLC, i take $15,1 billion in total assets and divide it by $3,2 billion free cash Flow = 4,7 years...

But that's kinda low right? Am i doing something wrong? I feel like a company which has such a low ratio should be worth more.",5,22,1731677172.0
Alibaba shares rise 3% in premarket after Chinese tech giant posts 58% jump in profit,"Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba on Friday beat profit expectations in its September quarter, citing an acceleration in growth in its cloud business unit.

Net income came in 43.9 billion Chinese yuan ($6.07 billion), compared with a LSEG outlook of 25.83 billion yuan.

Revenue reached 236.5 billion yuan ($32.72 billion), versus an analyst forecast of 238.9 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.

The company’s New York-listed shares have gained ground this year to date, up almost 17% as of Friday. The stock was up 3% in premarket trading at 11:43 a.m. London time, after the release of the quarterly earnings.

The results come at a tricky time for Chinese commerce businesses, given a tepid retail environment that reflects broader sluggishness in the world’s second-largest economy.

Markets are now watching whether a slew of recent stimulus measures from Beijing, including a five-year 1.4-trillion-yuan package announced last week, will help resuscitate the country’s growth and curtail a long-lived real estate market slump.

The impact on the retail space looks promising so far, with sales rising by a better-than-expected 4.8% year-on-year in October, while China’s recent Singles’ Day shopping holiday — widely seen as a barometer for national consumer sentiment — regained some of its luster.

Alibaba touted “robust growth” in gross merchandise volume — an industry measure of sales over time that does not equate to the company’s revenue — for its Taobao and Tmall Group businesses during the festival, along with a “record number of active buyers.”

“Alibaba’s outlook remains closely aligned with the trajectory of the Chinese economy and evolving regulatory policies,” ING analysts said Thursday, noting that the company’s Friday report will shed light on the Chinese economy’s growth momentum.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Why is Buffet buying Domino's DPZ with -$112 book value?,"Just curious if anyone has insight, maybe an accounting background.  If you have read much about Warren Buffet you know other than his wealth, his claim to fame is value investing and his company's namesake, Berkshire Hathaway all started with a takeover of a company he found that was being traded at a significant discount to book value.

So I have to ask, how is he evaluating stocks now?  I saw that they took a decent stake in DPZ and look up the financials and note the company was trading for $430 per share with a book value of -$112 per share.  Obviously, not a lot of attention is paid to Book value these days by most investors, but this is one of the largest discrepancies I've ever seen between market price and book value.  So I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on why he would ignore those figures?  I know it's a strong business still I'm curious why Buffet would not be scared away by the discrepancy if he's a value investor.",303,195,1731662511.0

What is the point of this and how does this work advantageously for him? And how risky is this?

"Robotics, Cyber-Security, Beverage and Industrial Stocks ","I wanted to buy some individual stocks today from 4 different industries. After some extensive research I landed on these 4 industries: robotics, cyber-security, beverages and industrial. 

The four companies I landed on were SYM, S, BROS, and ATMU. 

Symbiotic, $SYM is a robotic warehouse company located in Massachusetts. Its number one customer is Walmart and is also partnered with Target, Unfi. They are showing strong revenue growth and on the verge of positive net income. At 20 billion dollars it seems fairly valued when compared to other robotics companies like ABB which has a 100 billion dollar market cap. I think SYM has the opportunity to take some more of their market share. 

$S, SentinelOne, is a cyber-security company worth roughly 9 billion dollars. It can be compared to Cloudflare and Palo Alto. At about a quarter of the valuation, there is a lot of room for growth. 

$BROS, Dutch Bros is a coffee / beverage company that has been expanding like wild fire. It opened over 30 new shops last quarter. And just popped 30% after last earnings. I believe this company is on a similar trajectory as Starbucks, and seems to have even more momentum than Starbucks, Gen Z is obsessed with their drinks and the line is always very long. A risky growth play, but intriguing. 

$ATMU is a water filtration company valued at 3.6 billion and has a PE of 20 and has growing revenue and net income. A strong value play in my opinion, and very highly regarded by analysts. Seemed like a no brainer to me. 

Would love to hear your opinions on the stocks, and would like to know if you have better options in these 4 industries. I opened a small position today in these 4 stocks. ",65,31,1731539826.0
Cisco reports fourth straight quarter of declining revenue,"Cisco reported a fourth straight quarter of declining revenue even as results topped analysts’ estimates. The stock slipped about 1% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** 91 cents adjusted vs. 87 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $13.84 billion vs. $13.77 billion expected

Cisco’s revenue dropped 6% in the quarter ended Oct. 26, from $14.7 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income fell to $2.71 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $3.64 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

Networking revenue plunged 23% to $6.75 billion, slightly below the $6.8 billion consensus of analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Security revenue doubled to $2.02 billion, topping the StreetAccount consensus of $1.93 billion. Cisco’s revenue from collaboration was $1.09 billion, a bit below the $1.04 billion consensus estimate.

Chuck Robbins, Cisco’s CEO, said on a Wednesday conference call that orders from large-scale clients for artificial intelligence infrastructure exceeded $300 million in the quarter. Server makers such as Dell and HPE have also focused on sales of hardware that can help clients implement generative AI.

“We have earned more design wins and remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from web-scale customers,” Robbins said.

U.S. government agencies have delayed deals with Cisco, rather than scrapping them altogether, Robbins said.

During the quarter, Cisco acquired security startups DeepFactor and Robust Intelligence.

Cisco lifted its full-year guidance to $3.60 to $3.66 in adjusted earnings per share on $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion in revenue, up from a prior forecast of $3.52 to $3.58 in EPS and $55 billion to $56.2 billion in revenue. Guidance would indicate projected revenue growth of 3.3% at the middle of the range.

Analysts expected adjusted earnings for the year of $3.58 per share on $55.89 billion in revenue.

As of Wednesday’s close, Cisco’s stock was up 17% year to date, while the S&P 500 index, is up around 26% over that stretch.

"AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees","AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

SoundHound AI Stock Tumbles as Margins Drop ,"Source: Investopedia

[ SoundHound AI (SOUN) shares plunged 16% Wednesday, a day after the provider of artificial intelligence (AI) voice technology software reported a big drop in gross margin. 


The Nvidia (NVDA)-backed company’s third-quarter GAAP gross margin sank 24.3 percentage points to 48.6%, and non-GAAP gross margin tumbled 14.0 percentage points to 59.7%. 


That offset an otherwise powerful financial report, with its loss per share of $0.06 beating the $0.10 loss per share expected by analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Revenue soared 89% year-over-year to a record $25.1 million, also above forecasts. ]",45,10,1731532558.0
"NICE Ltd., an undervalued AI stock that is positioned well whether or not generative AI even works","There may be literally only one stock that has not been swept up by AI hysteria, despite pivoting their business model to adapt to the prospect of generative AI - NICE Ltd.

NICE Ltd., headquartered in Ra'anana, Israel, provides advanced cloud-based software for customer experience (CX) and financial crime prevention. NICE specializes in AI-driven platforms like CXone, which supports customer engagement through AI-based customer routing, automated interactions, and real-time analytics. Their Enlighten AI suite enhances contact center operations by helping agents offer more responsive, personalized service. They also offer solutions for digital evidence management and fraud detection, serving sectors like public safety, law enforcement, and financial compliance.

NICE has been quietly rising ahead of their **earnings call tomorrow**, currently trading around $200. However, it is still WELL off of their high of $250. Their stock price the last several months has seen a sharp decline due to their longtime CEO, Barak Eilam, announcing his departure that will take place at the end of 2024. NICE, in my opinion, has taken an unfair beating for this news. Their replacement, Scott Russell, is an interesting hire due to his experience in the APAC market at a company the size of SAP and his international experience.

NICE has not penetrated the European and APAC market well at all, and this could be an incredible opportunity to grow revenue in those markets with his appointment. They are already well entrenched in some of the largest F500 companies in the Americas. It's about time they start looking abroad.

To speak on the tech itself, and whether or not generative AI will work in this industry, that itself represents an interesting scenario for NICE. In my opinion, whether or not AI works, NICE is positioned well. Their last earnings call, analysts asked Barak specifically about whether or not their generative AI systems are being used by their customers. He mentioned their proprietary ""co-pilot"", internally-faced AI used by customer service agents is being heavily utilized, and bookings is up 100% YOY for the technology, but that there is definitely still some hesitancy to roll out a generative AI customer service platform to the end consumer. This is fine, in my opinion, because if conceptually it doesn't work, NICE's technology is needed, and will serve the market as it has for years. If generative AI is the solution this industry will need, then they are even better positioned for that against the market with their technology. 

Some of the risks that I've heard. One is valid the other isn't. It is an Israeli based company, so there are going to be risks endemic there that are inevitable, which is valid.

I also hear about how large companies like Microsoft and Amazon will enter this market and take away market share. This is really unlikely. Microsoft, for example, tried to do a CRM tool and it is truly dogshit and has close to zero market share. And CX software requires much more domain expertise than doing a CRM tool, which they failed spectacularly at. 

I'll spare you the valuation work but...Anyway, stock is fairly priced close to $300, and is currently trading at $200. I got in at $165 earlier this year, but this is still a great opportunity.

Liberty Media to spin off assets; CEO Greg Maffei to step down at year-end,">Liberty Media announced Wednesday it’s spinning off most assets besides Formula One auto racing into a separate publicly traded company, called Liberty Live, and that CEO Greg Maffei is stepping down at year-end. Chairman John Malone will become interim CEO of Liberty Media. Liberty Media’s investor day is set to take place on Thursday in Manhattan. After the split, Liberty Media will hold Formula One, which Liberty acquired in 2016 and later spun out as a tracking stock, and MotoGP, upon the closing of that transaction. Liberty Live will hold roughly 69.9 million shares of Live Nation Entertainment, sports experiences provider Quint and certain other assets, according to a release.

>The company also announced cable company Charter Communications  would acquire Liberty Broadband in an all-stock transaction. In September, Liberty Broadband went public with its aspirations to merge with Charter, in a move to simplify Malone’s portfolio. Liberty owns 26% of Charter shares. The Liberty Media and Liberty Live split is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025, and the sale of Liberty Broadband to Charter is expected to be completed in mid-2027. “The split-off of Liberty Live Group into a separate public entity will simplify Liberty Media’s capital structure, should reduce the discount to net asset value of our Liberty Live stock and enhance trading liquidity at both entities,” Maffei said in a release.

>Following today’s announcements at Liberty Media and Liberty Broadband, all the Liberty acquisitions completed during my tenure are now in structures where shareholders can have more direct ownership in their upside,” Maffei said in a separate release. “While it’s never easy to leave an organization as dynamic as Liberty, I am confident that this is the right time.” Maffei has been part of Liberty since 2005 and has various positions on boards of the company’s assets, including Charter. Malone is a pioneer of the cable industry, long known as the “cable cowboy,” and has kept his hand in various media assets over the years. He’s been an independent director of Warner Bros. Discovery — initially through Discovery, before the company merged with Warner Bros., under his advisement.

Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

Here a [chart of Apple](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SDXjHW8c/) when it made most sense to hold them and when they lost a lot.",38,76,1731495213.0

However, in cases like American Airlines or Hertz they were able to keep equity for shareholders.

(AHR) I’m back as promised; +44% since first post; senior living healthcare REIT sector outperforming; earnings release once again beat est.,"My first two posts: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/4OEM4c1Bq9

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/bKcUEjlglR

All in all with the rise and fall of recession fears and the hovering election reactions - to cover the catalysts as of previous:

Federal rate cuts and lessening borrowing fees, growing average senior age, dwindling rates of new construction resulting in higher occupancy rates, and greater focus on specialized senior healthcare. 

For American Healthcare REIT - Currently the peak was +44% from initial post - with earnings from today beating wall street analyst EPS by 12.5% and beating YoY growth in 3/4 asset incomes. With debt, asset evaluations and growth rate as a rough value estimate, I believe it’s nearing the $30 fair value since it’s IPO earlier this year after they have purchased the final 24% minority stake of Trilogy Healthcare which has generated the majority of revenue from the company. They’ve done a stand up job making focuses on specialized care for senior homes and removing the outpatient medical properties, selling them off as they’ve been underperforming as of recent. I expect more reports of increased occupancy rates nearing 90% which would be pre-Covid levels. 

For the healthcare REIT sector - over the past year with recovery from COVID effects - the healthcare REIT stock sector has outperformed the US market by 22.7%, and the real estate sector in general by 65.8%. With the constantly increased forward guidance every quarter for AHR  and associated senior living REITs and the narrowing rate of new constructions that aren’t set to appear in bulk in the industry at least for a year or so - I expect the atmosphere to be relatively competitive.

The sector i believe will stay strong in the long run but especially right now during times of expensive new constructions costs, while dwindling interest rates (for now) will most likely give way to these companies projecting new asset properties to expand their revenue streams, the landscape is tight while the populace of seniors continues to grow by the day. 

NOTE: Earnings release can be found here

I'm aware that its just gambling and I've accepted the potential of losing all $800 i just wanna get some trading  experience have a little fun and maybe learn some stuff

First thing I did was buy some MCD during the Ecoli thing and sold it when it went back up (made $10) then I found this company Tetra Tech (TTEK) and bought 8 shares at $46. I did this because I saw they recently won a 12 billion contract with DLA as well as a couple other multi million dollar gov contracts. 

  
Price has gone up a little its only been a week or less but I'm confused am I totally misreading how stocks work. I would assume when a company starts making a ton of money the stock goes up. 

Obviously they havent earned that 12 billion yet but are these contracts not as concrete as they seem? Am I thinking stupidly about this? 

Another red flag is that in the last year it looks like the CEO and CFO have sold millions worth of shares.

Any advice would be much appreciated!",7,5,1731435106.0
Disney - what am I getting for $100?,"Starting a new conversation on DIS, as the last one is almost 3 month old. My tone will be neutral, because I'm just contemplating my decision about DIS stock. Don't know Long or Short?

So, what does $100 buy me:

* Disney+ streaming service with 130M subscribers. That's half of NFLX. You do the math. Punish Disney for ""meh"" content quality in comparison to NFLX, but then, not everyone needs *edge of chair, nail biting* content. Think about boomers who just want to look at a glowing TV screen with drama soaps on.
* Top notch studios like Marvel, Pixar, 20th century, ABC. Sports network of ESPN.
* Theme parks in US, Paris, China, Tokyo. Cruise line (probably a cash burner).
* New CEO in early 2026, meaning.. plenty of time for Iger to look for a new job, leverage, armtwist whatever he has in mind.
* PE of 38 against 12 of Comcast.

All things considered, I'll pass. Stock price movement too is so ""meh"" that it's not even worth shorting 🤣

Anyone else getting nervous about an impending recession?,"Prices feel inflated.  Tomorrow's prices are priced in today and as that continues every day at some point that logic ceases to be ""investing"" but rather ""speculation"" and thats the key-word behind every bubble.

If you've listened/read anything from the most successful investors, all the red flags they bring up are being seen now.   When EVERYONE is so optimistic is now whats making me most nervous.  If you read about major crashes and recessions of the past, they are always precipitated with quotes from investors about how if you're not in the market you're losing out and everythings looking great, future is great,

Tariffs will be inflationary.  Tax cuts will disproportionately favor big businesses.  Interest rates are going down because the fed is reactionary. All of these have the recipe for inflation to increase again but this time squeezing americans to the point where buying stops.  It will also induce a panic in the market that might trigger a large correction.   Trump wants to increase local production which will help in the short-run, but his foreign policy is unpredictable so hard to say what oil imports will do.

I think most people have some cautious optimism, but at what point does it become more caution than optimism?

How has Walgreens not cut their dividend yet?,"I have never held a position in WBA but I do follow the stock. After the beating they took throughout the year, the missed earning and the store closures, I figured it was a certainty they would cut their dividend. Amazingly they have not done so and still sit on a 10% yield. On one hand I am tempted to enter a position just because of the ridiculous yield, but I can’t believe it’s sustainable. Nevertheless the 10% yield has held for nearly 6 months and I’m starting to feel like if the business doesn’t actually fold it could actually be a solid way to park some funds and maybe capture a turnaround play. It’s too risky for my blood but wanted to get others thoughts and opinions about this ridiculously high yield dividend on a struggling company ",35,34,1731412232.0

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Chipotle Mexican Grill names Scott Boatwright as permanent CEO,"Chipotle Mexican Grill on Monday named interim boss Scott Boatwright as permanent CEO of the burrito chain in a widely expected move, months after Brian Niccol exited the role to take the top job at Starbucks.

Boatwright, who has been at Chipotle since 2017, takes the helm as restaurants across the United States battle weak consumer demand in the face of higher menu prices.

In a surprise announcement in August, Starbucks named Niccol as its new CEO, leaving Chipotle under Boatwright, who has vowed to push the burrito chain to be a “global lifestyle brand” and expand to 7,000 restaurants in North America.

A veteran in the restaurant industry, Boatwright spent 18 years with Arby’s Restaurant Group before joining Chipotle in 2017.

He was named CEO following “a thorough and rigorous external search process,” Chipotle said in a statement on Monday.

Boatwright worked closely with Niccol to also steer the company out of a crisis following a severe E. coli and salmonella outbreak in 2015.

“Boatwright was by far the most logical choice given his instrumental role in leading Chipotle’s efforts to improve operations, integrate new technology, reduce employee turnover, and bolster customer satisfaction,” said Sharon Zackfia, analyst at William Blair.

His appointment as CEO comes amid a slew of changes to the top brass at Chipotle following Niccol’s exit. 

In August, Chipotle also accelerated the appointment of Adam Rymer as its chief financial officer, and named Rymer’s predecessor Jack Hartung as chief strategy officer.

Hartung was originally set to retire in March next year after a little over two decades as the company’s CFO. Rymer has been at Chipotle for 15 years, last serving as vice president of finance. 

“Boatwright as CEO should build confidence among investors in Chipotle’s management,” said Jim Sanderson, analyst at Northcoast Research. 

Chipotle’s stock lost $6 billion in market value immediately after Niccol’s departure. Since then, shares have risen about 14%.

This compares to NVDA's 4.2% weighting in the average retail portfolio a year ago

Elon Musk’s Trump bet has paid off so well that Tesla is now worth more than most of the rest of the car industry combined,"[https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/](https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/)

>Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s ‘all-in’ gamble to get Donald Trump elected president has proven so successful that a veritable chasm has opened up between his EV manufacturer and the rest of the auto industry. As conventional carmakers trade at rock-bottom prices amid a broad industry malaise brought on by China’s economic slowdown and growing fears of Trump tariffs, Tesla’s stock continues to soar, creating one of the biggest valuation gaps it’s ever seen.

>On Friday, Tesla reclaimed its place in the elite club of companies worth more than $1 trillion after adding a full third in market capitalization since Election Day less than a week ago. The last time Tesla was worth this amount of money it was April 2022, Musk had just revealed his $44 billion plan to acquire Twitter.

>Relative to its peers, Tesla is now worth more than the next 15 largest carmakers combined—from Toyota and General Motors all the way down to Jeep’s parent company Stellantis and Hyundai. Toss in lower ranked names like Kia and Renault, respectively worth $26.6 billion and $12.6 billion, and Tesla is still is still ahead, only drawing even once the $8.8 billion from Japan’s Nissan is thrown into the mix.",9734,762,1731344115.0
US Tech Stocks will push back against EU pressure as Trump signals tariffs and 'America First' policies,"Honestly, it feels like Apple and the whole US tech sector are finally standing up to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and all the over-the-top regulations. With Trump hinting at tariffs and pushing that ""America First"" vibe, the U.S. tech giants might finally have the leverage to say ""no thanks"" to a lot of the stuff Europe’s trying to force on them. The DMA is supposed to keep things competitive, but for companies like Apple, it’s just restrictive and honestly impacts their ability to innovate. If the U.S. government throws its weight behind them, these companies could really start pulling back from Europe’s grip and go about their business without being bogged down by EU red tape.



Europe’s supposed to be an innovation hub, but it’s really starting to look like the opposite. For startups, the endless admin, complex regulations, and sky-high taxes make it pretty much impossible to thrive. You have great ideas coming out of Europe, but the bureaucracy and costs just suffocate them before they can take off. Compare that to the U.S., where taxes are lower and there’s way less red tape, and you can see why so many are ditching Europe altogether. It’s like the EU’s digging its own grave when it comes to tech innovation, and the U.S. might be there to pick up the pieces.

What is pushing SOFI to a different stratosphere after it is up 54.64% in 1 Month,"Lower volume is usually expected today correlated with no Bond trading on this Veterans Day. With $13 Options in the Money this past Friday and the Option Chain bullish at $15 by the end of this week, it is possible to see a spike in SoFi stock today given the combination of Shorts%, Low volume, Options in the Money, and the positive sentiment from the bullish Option Chain.

Plus the following:

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* As of June 2024, Americans owe about $1.6 trillion in student loans, 42% more than they owed a decade earlier.  SoFi has approximately 60% of the private student loan refinancing market.
* SoFi has reached 1 year of full profitability after Q3 2024.
* Institutional ownership is the highest it has ever been at 45.6% (Probably even higher when the new number comes out)
* SoFi wants to get loans from high-quality borrowers with high FICO scores. They were rejecting about 80% of the applicants.  They can easily raise that risk and jump their business as long as it stays within the default margin for profitability.   Their large increase in customers every quarter allows them to get low-cost funding for lending out money given their bank charter status, unlike many other Fintechs that don't have a bank charter.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely abandon the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.
* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price jumps.
* Bank stock rose 20% three months after the election in 2016.",177,57,1731330545.0
Is there still runway for $TTWO?,"For disclosure: I bought in TTWO at a cost basis around 140 last November after the official announcement by Rockstar about GTA 6. I am not looking to hold the stock long-term, but rather capitalise on the short-term wave brought about by GTA 6. My initial exit was 180, but the stock has reached this level almost entirely by the post-election rally, without much accounting for the catalyst I initially had in mind.

I am extremely bullish about the materiality of GTA 6's release on TTWO. Investors were likely anxious if GTA 6 was still able to draw the same hype as its predecessors did, but the official trailer on 6 Nov last year proved so. It broke the world record for highest number of first-day views for a non-music video, and is now the most-liked game trailer of all time. In response, share price increased by 20% over the next month as the market geared for more news. I continue to believe GTA 6 will be wildly popular with the general public - drawing milennials for nostalgia's sake and Gen Z (and onwards) who finally have a GTA title of their own generation.

For comparison, GTA 5 sold 11m copies and 800m in revenue within the first 24 hours. Analysts expect GTA 6 to eclipse 1B revenue in the first day, which already equals an entire quarter's worth of revenue. I believe these estimates are rather conservative, given how far the console/PC gaming market has advanced over the past decade. It is reasonable to expect GTA 6 to be a complete sell-out given all the reasons above. 

Last week, management finally gave us visibility of a GTA 6 release in Fall of 2025. This is already a bit of a delay given that management had previously hinted at a ""significant inflection point"" in 1Q25 which I had read as at least a pre-release. Therefore, there is a material risk that the company further delays the launch again; or worse, the product is a let-down.

I am wondering, if you think that the GTA 6 momentum has already been fully priced in on fundamentals, or if there is still further upside. ",7,25,1731327715.0

SAAB - Swedish arms manufacturer,"Swedish arms manufacturer SAAB is a forgotten gem among European defense stocks. Like all other defense stocks, SAAB gained a lot in the beginning of the Ukraine war and is now trading at around P/E 30 which is historically high and not that impressive.   
  
What makes the stock interesting now is how many orders have been coming in lately and how the price of the stock hasn't skyrocketed further in response, yet at least. Relative to other arms manufacturers, SAAB is not that large and their potential market cap is enormous.  
  
I initially bought a small position in SAAB because I was impressed with the fighter jet Gripen and figured that given the quite small current market cap it just takes 1-3 countries to adopt the Gripen system to massively increase the revenue for SAAB. Nowadays the orders just keep coming in, and the stock price is not really keeping up, so I've bought more shares. Colombia just decided to buy Gripen and Brazil is going to expand their fleet.  
Apart from Gripen, which is of course the crown jewel of SAABs products they also make the NLAW anti tank missile, AT4 anti tank missiles, radar systems, top tier camouflage fabrics and a lot of other high tech defense related products.

Future of Energy Stocks ,"So I've been doing some research about energy stocks, here are some of my thoughts:

Clean energy stocks have been dropping significantly in these few days, but I am optismistic it will go up in the forseeable future, here's why:

1: Solar and Offshore Wind are fundamentally more cost effective than natural gas alternatives, meaning these are profitable business model that businesses will develop regardless of government subsidies.

2: The IRA will unlikely to be fully repealed due to the massive amounts of employment it provides to red states.

3: While tariff will make clean energy projects more expensive on net, it also gradually reduces US clean energy firms' reliance on China which means a stronger future for the companies.

4: With regard to oil stocks, I believe the price of oil will drop significantly since drill baby drill which means Trump will expand oil drilling in the continental shells, so lower priced oil will reduce profit margins for oil companies, making oil stocks perform worst.

Celanese. Asking community's thoughts on a midcap industrial name.,"Hello, I hope a post like this is allowed.

I am looking at a company stock ticker CE. They are a chemicals company. The recent crash in share price is what prompted me to ""kick the tires"" on this name.

I am looking specifically at their balance sheet.

They have about 12B in long term debt. They made a big acquisition a few years back for about 10B. They essentially have 12B of bonds of which about 1B come due every year.

This year, they did not make enough money to pay off their bonds so they drew down 1B from their cash to pay off their bond. Now they only have 800m cash left. They anticipate that they cannot pay off their 2025 bonds and have already arranged short term financing to pay it off. Their debt coverage ratio is 1.4.

They are shutting down plants left and right to save money. They cut their dividend by 95%.

My question is simple. Considering the state of their finances (it's very bad not sugarcoating it), is this a good investment at current price? And if not, is there a price at which you would be interested?",9,7,1731165697.0
Diversifying my Portfolio (ASX),"Hey all,

I recently got into Stocks last week

I deposited so far $10k into VAS Top 300 AU, $10k into VGS International (This one has been underperforming also tempted to sell it for another international ETF which has less companies in it any recommendations on ETF's of this type to look into?, $10k into NDQ Tech 100, $2800 into CSL and $67k into the S&P500 (IVV)

(Made a mistake with the CSL because it hae a weighting of over 5% in VAS but I am not sure if its bad to sell it for another stock because Tax reasons? Can someone advise me if I should just leave it?

I constantly hear some people talk about just putting all or 99% into S&P500 and then I hear the opposite argument of needing to be diversified in not just US and AUS but also WW and also even at what percentages you should have in each Stock

Personally for this reason I did put some of my Stocks into AUS and WW (As per above) but because of the past think the returns on the S&P500 will be better hence why I have overweighted it (I know the past does not have to repeat iself) but my risk tolerance is somewhat high being married at 30 with no kids and wanting to make my first million ASAP but I am feeling like maybe I have far too high a weighting in the USA is my main question, and if I do with my remaining 50k is it worth sacrificing potential returns from S&P 500 to diversify more? i'd love opinions on this because current plan is just to go ham on the S&P500

Do you all think this is a good strategy or I should really make an effort to Diversify more? Also I was thinking of buying VHY because I do not have many good Dividend Stocks yet, any advice welcome I only started investing a week ago",7,1,1731159480.0

"MBLY is the next Trump / Elon stock. 10 bagger
","MBLY (Mobileye) is the leader in autonomous driving technology supplying automakers.

Are the NANC and CRUZ tracking ETF’s a good investment you're implementing in your portfolio?,"With all the talk this election about congressional insider trading and looking at these various Saas and ETF options that follow US representative trades I was curious what y'all perspective was on these and if you're taking them seriously at all as a diversification play or if they are just kind of meme ETF's.

The NANC ETF aims to track the stock trades made by members of Congress and their spouses, focusing on trades involving Democratic members. As of September 30, 2024, NANC hit a one-year total return of about 40%, Whoa, which outpaces the S&P 500's gain of around 22% over the same period​.

On the other hand, the KRUZ ETF, which tracks trades by Republican members of Congress, has generally shown competitive returns but with less gains than NANC. 

Both ETFs seem to be a part of a broader trend in thematic investing that targets political market behavior which is interesting. Their management fees/expense ratio are both 0.75% which feels super high compared to like VOO (.03%).

These are both relatively new. And presumably could also be made obsolete if certain legislation passes that bans Congressional reps from investing while serving. 

Just wanted to get others take on these. Appreciate your time!

The same thing happened with DFEN (a leveraged ETF). I bought it at $35 couple weeks ago, it dropped to $32, and after the election, I sold it at $35.10, as I was just trying to recoup my money, thinking it would continue to decline after the hype. Now the stock is at $37.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Are certificated shares ever *not* with a transfer agent?,"I am Per Rep in the estate of my deceased Dad who held on to paper stock certificates from the 1970s, which were part of his own inheritance. The stock is Federal-Mogul corporation. I have located the transfer agent, eqshareowners. I have learned that these are referred to as 'certificated shares'.

The certificated shares have not been altered like if they had been cancelled, like is common after they are converted. I have seen these since my childhood; there's no chance that they're fake. There's also the original receipt from his stock inheritance in his file.

I called eq shareowners and the process stops when they ask what his account number was. They ask for his last 5 of his ss#. We've gone over the date of purchase, shares and certificate numbers. The process comes to a screeching halt because of the lack of an account number.   There are other stocks in other accounts of his with eqshareowners, just not one for these 2. ""Without an account number, I cannot proceed with any information."" 

I have not found any paperwork or record of these shares ever being registered. Is it possible that these shares were never registered because they are very pre-internet? Am I calling and asking the wrong question? Do I need to call and ask *how to register them to create an account?*

Pinterest stock plunges following weak Q4 revenue guidance,"Pinterest shares plunged 15% Thursday after the social media company provided soft guidance for its fourth-quarter revenue despite it beating the top and bottom lines with its third-quarter earnings.

Here’s how the company performed, according to LSEG:

* **Revenue**: $898 million vs. $896 million expected
* **Earnings per share:** 40 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expected

The company said that fourth-quarter revenue will be between the range of $1.125 million to $1.145 million. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 million, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 million.

Sales in Pinterest’s third-quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.

Pinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  

The company’s net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.

Pinterest’s latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.

Last week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.

Alphabet said during its third-quarter earnings last week that advertising sales in the period grew 10% year over year to $65.85 billion while its YouTube video unit reported ad revenue of $8.92 billion, up 12% from the previous year.

Microsoft said last week that its search and news advertising revenue jumped 18% year over year as part of its latest earnings report, but the company does not reveal that unit’s specific quarterly sales numbers.

Reddit and Snap also reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Reddit said that sales in its third quarter soared 68% to $348.4 million from the prior year while Snap’s third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year to $1.37 billion.

Airbnb stock up 8% as revenue jumps,"Airbnb reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday that were shy of analyst estimates, though it squeaked in a small revenue beat. The stock jumped about 8% in after-hours trading.

Here’s how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.13 vs. $2.14 expected by LSEG
* **Revenue:** $3.73 billion vs. $3.72 billion expected by LSEG

Revenue increased 10% from $3.4 billion a year earlier. Airbnb reported a net income of $1.37 billion, or $2.13 per share, compared to $4.37 billion, or $6.63 per share, in the same period last year.

The company expects to report revenue between $2.39 billion and $2.44 billion during its fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $2.42 billion for the period, according to LSEG.

In its letter to shareholders, Airbnb said it is focused on expanding beyond its core markets and into under-penetrated markets around the globe. The average growth rate of nights booked in Airbnb’s expansion markets was double that of its core markets on an origin basis during the third quarter, the company said.

“We’ll remain focused on accelerating growth while preparing for Airbnb’s next chapter, which will take us beyond accommodations,” Airbnb said. “You’ll see more on this next year.”

Airbnb said adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $2 billion, up 7% year over year. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting $1.86 billion.

Gross booking value, used by Airbnb to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $20.1 billion in the third quarter. That’s above the $19.9 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. The company reported 123 million nights and experiences booked, up 8% from a year ago, and higher than the 121.4 million expected by StreetAccount.

Airbnb said it saw hosting growth across all regions and market types during the third quarter. The company has more than 8 million active listings and has worked to improve listing quality, according to its shareholder letter. Airbnb has removed more than 300,000 listings since last year.

Average daily rates increased 1% from a year ago to $164 in the third quarter, the company said.

1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [https://archive.is/v40zX](https://archive.is/v40zX)

SoFi is in the accelerated growth phase going into a much friendlier upcoming environment for financial institutions.,"SoFi is in the accelerated growth phase and its growth will dramatically benefit from the upcoming much friendlier environment for financial institutions:

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The probable upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely scale back or scrap the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses.

Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**

**Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.

**No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers. 

**SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….

>

**Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.

**Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America. 

**Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.

**Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.

**A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.

**Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different

The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.

The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.

Covered Calls hoping for execution Risks?,"I am new to covered calls, and I know that the typical strategy is hoping that the call is not executed and just collecting money from premiums. I was wondering, though, as a way to make quick capital if there were any risks in selling covered calls, and I'm hoping that they are executed. It's like buying a 100's stocks that you think are decent but then going down the option chain and selling a 2-year contract with a strike price of a couple $ of or even cents over, knowing that the shares will be called away.

  
I know that obviously, there is the downside that your stock goes below and is more in the red than your premium. But say a company is trading at $4 right now, so $400 for 100 shares. and a 2 year contract call is at $5 strike at $250 premium. 

Is it a good strategy to hope that you get that $100 + the $250 premium, ignoring the opportunity costs or are there risks I'm over looking",6,11,1730820195.0
"Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers","So, will there be any new car model for Tesla in 2025???

&#x200B;

**Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers**  
[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05)

&#x200B;

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*",748,374,1730815541.0
Oil giant Saudi Aramco posts 15% drop in third-quarter profit but maintains dividend,"Saudi state oil giant Aramco reported a 15.4% drop in net profit in the third-quarter on the back of “lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins,” but maintained a 31.05 billion dividend.

The company reported net income of $27.56 billion in the July-September period, topping a company-provided estimate of $26.9 billion. The print is also a 5% drop from the previous quarter, which came in at $29.1 billion, as lower global oil prices, weaker demand and prolonged OPEC+ production cuts led by Saudi Arabia continue to impact crude prices.

The average selling price of oil for the second quarter of 2024 stood at $85 per barrel, but dropped to $78.7 per barrel during the third quarter, according to Saudi-based bank Al Rajhi capital, as non-OPEC supply volumes grew.

The oil firm said its year-on-year decline was partly offset by a “reduction in selling, administrative and general expenses primarily driven by a gain from derivative instruments, and a decrease in production royalties largely reflecting lower crude oil prices and a lower average effective royalty rate compared to the same quarter last year.”

Aramco’s dividend includes a base payout of $20.3 billion and an atypical performance-linked one of $10.8 billion. The Saudi government and the kingdom’s sovereign wealth vehicle, the Public Investment Fund, are the main beneficiaries of the dividend, holding stakes of roughly 81.5% and 16% in the company.

The remaining shareholding trades freely on Saudi Arabia’s Tadāwul stock exchange, with the company having finalized its second public share offering back in June.

Aramco’s earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) came in at $51.45 billion in the third quarter, down 17% year-on-year. Aramco’s capital expenditure guidance was brought up 20% to $13.23 billion.

The company was trading at 27.45 riyals following the announcement, down 0.18% on the previous day.

The earnings align with a broader trend across oil majors, whose third-quarter profits have also suffered from declines in crude prices and refining margins. Aramco said it achieved average realized crude price of $79.3 per barrel in the third quarter, compared with $89.3 per barrel in the same period of last year.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter who produces roughly 9 million barrels per day of crude at present, serves as the de facto leader of the OPEC+ oil producers’ alliance, a subset of whom agreed over the weekend to delay a planned December output hike by one month.

“Aramco delivered robust net income and generated strong free cash flow during the third quarter, despite a lower oil price environment,” CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement. “We also progressed our upstream developments, strengthened our downstream value chain, and advanced our new energies program as we continue to invest through cycles.”

The revenues will be a boon to the Saudi economy, which is currently undergoing a diversification process under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s legacy Vision 2030 scheme spanning a slew of high-cost infrastructure “gigaprojects.”

Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Finance cut the kingdom’s growth forecast to 0.8% in 2024, in a steep decline from a previous projection of 4.4%, and raised the outlook for the national budgetary shortfall to roughly 2.9% of GDP, from a prior indication of 1.9%.

Nvidia Overtakes Apple to Become World's Largest Company,"
Nvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.

Nvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.

That gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Continued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.

The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks: It Has to Do With Data,"Hi, everyone. I'm not formally trained in computer science or finance. I'm just someone who is passionate about the transformative potential of AI, financial markets and investing, among other topics.   
  
I've been working on an ""investment thesis"" of sorts (shown below) that involves a potential risk that seems to be somewhat overlooked in discussions about AI stocks. I am sharing it here in the hope that it might spark some interesting and fruitful conversation, particularly among those more experienced in the field of AI.  


**The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks:** While investors focus on the AI hardware race and GPU shortages, a more fundamental challenge looms: the growing scarcity of high-quality, diverse data for training advanced AI systems, particularly AGI. This overlooked bottleneck could significantly impact AI company valuations and the timeline for AGI development (if it can be achieved at all).  
  
**Current Market Narrative**  
◾Investors fixate on computing power, driving up valuations of hardware-focused companies.  
◾The prevailing logic: more GPUs equal more AI capability and value, which overlooks a critical flaw in the race towards AGI.  
  
**The Real Bottleneck**  
AI performance, especially for AGI aspirations, hinges on three data factors:  
◾ Quality: Accuracy and reliability  
◾Quantity: Volume of useful examples  
◾Diversity: Range of scenarios represented  
  
While data quantity grows exponentially, we face a 'data wall' - the supply of high-quality, novel, human-generated data becoming insufficient for advanced AI training and development. This poses critical risks:  
◾Closed-loop AI content generation leading to digital entropy and degraded data quality/diversity  
◾Amplification of biases and errors in AI outputs  
◾Fundamental limitations on achieving true general intelligence  
  
Emerging AI techniques like few-shot learning offer potential ways to scale this data wall but may not fully address the complex data needs for AGI development. Notably, while synthetic data can augment datasets, it cannot replace the richness and variability of real-world data essential for true understanding.  
  
**Key Takeaways:**  
◾ Data scarcity is a critical risk in AI investment.  
◾ The ""data wall"" limits advancements in AI/AGI.  
◾ Quality, Quantity, and Diversity of data are essential for AI performance.  
◾ Emerging techniques may help but have limitations.  
◾ Synthetic data cannot fully substitute for real-world data.

**Overvaluation Risks**  
◾ Companies valued primarily on computational capacity  
◾ Firms lacking robust data acquisition strategies  
◾ Businesses dependent on public/synthetic data  
  
**Hidden Opportunities**  
◾ Companies with unique data access  
◾ Firms innovating in data collection and curation  
◾ Enterprises focused on diverse, high-quality datasets crucial for AGI  
  
**Regulatory Considerations**  
◾ Evolving privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) create new challenges  
◾ Data access restrictions limit large-scale dataset use  
◾ Cross-border data flow regulations risk creating regional ""data silos""  
◾ Demands for algorithmic transparency necessitate diverse, well-documented training data  
  
**Investment Framework**  
**Key Questions:**  
◾ What’s their data sourcing strategy for advanced AI and potential AGI?  
◾ Do they have unique high-quality data access?  
◾ How sustainable is their data advantage in the AGI race?   
◾ What if data becomes the primary constraint for AGI achievement?  
  
**Risk Indicators:**  
◾ Over-reliance on public datasets  
◾ Lack of proprietary data sources  
◾ Limited data diversity for general intelligence tasks  
◾ No clear data quality maintenance strategy  
  
**Portfolio Implications**  
**Large Cap AI Stocks:**  
◾ Reassess hardware-centric valuations  
◾ Seek evidence of sustainable data advantages for AI development  
◾ Consider data quality risk exposure in long-term AI/AGI strategies  
  
**Emerging Players:**  
◾ Identify genuine data moat builders with AGI potential  
◾ Seek innovative data acquisition approaches for general intelligence  
◾ Prioritize quality and diversity over mere quantity  
  
**The Long View**  
◾ The demand for high-quality data transcends economics, entering geopolitical realms  
◾ ""Data wars"" may emerge as nations battle for data supremacy  
◾ AGI achievement may prove more complex than current valuations suggest  
  
**Questions for Investors**  
◾ How are you factoring data constraints into AI valuations, especially for companies pursuing AGI?  
◾ What metrics evaluate a company's data advantages in the context of general intelligence development?  
◾ How might data bottlenecks reshape the AI landscape and AGI timelines?

I hope this perspective provides new insights into AI investment risks and opportunities, especially regarding the pursuit of AGI. I'm eager to hear others' thoughts on these potential market dynamics and data challenges in the journey towards general artificial intelligence. ",70,48,1730730157.0

SnowFlake’s Stock Buyback and Short-Term Optimism,"Snowflake recently issued two billion dollars in zero-percent-interest convertible senior notes due in 2027 and 2029, which reflects a high level of confidence from both management and investors about the company’s short-term growth potential. Here’s a breakdown of what this move means and why Snowflake might be taking this route:

The cash from this debt issuance will partially fund a stock buyback program, reducing the number of shares on the market, which often has the effect of lifting stock price by making shares scarcer. By buying back shares, Snowflake is aiming to support the stock price in the short term, potentially improving per-share earnings and appealing to investors.

So, why take on this debt if it’s going toward share buybacks? Snowflake’s move suggests they’re anticipating significant growth in the near future, likely from strong revenue and demand for their data cloud services. With the convertible notes carrying no interest payments, Snowflake doesn’t need to worry about traditional debt servicing costs. Investors instead receive an option to convert these notes into Snowflake stock, but only if the share price climbs to a level that makes the conversion profitable.

A key detail here is that these notes have a 40% conversion premium, meaning investors would only convert their notes to stock if Snowflake’s price rises significantly above current levels. If this happens, the notes convert into shares, giving Snowflake a financial cushion now without immediate dilution for existing shareholders. They also implemented a capped call transaction to reduce the risk of dilution even if the stock does convert later on.

Essentially, this move aligns with a high-confidence outlook from Snowflake’s management. They seem to believe they’ll perform well enough in the short term to drive up their stock price and make this financing favorable for the company. This strategy could provide Snowflake with more flexibility for acquisitions, product investment, and even future stock or debt issuances at more favorable terms if their market valuation continues to rise.

While it’s a bold move, it’s not without risk. If Snowflake’s growth doesn’t match expectations, they’ll have taken on significant debt without the offsetting benefit of a higher stock price. But the confidence expressed in their growth trajectory—particularly in a competitive data market—is telling, and if they can execute their strategy effectively, this could be a smart way to support their stock while preparing for further expansion.",24,22,1730585326.0
Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

Questions on trading and trailing stop losses,"I use 2 different brokerage companies and have a single brokerage account with the first company (Robinhood) and I have a ROTH IRA and a brokerage account with the second company (Charles Schwab). 

I have finally been able to stuff over $25k into the Schwab brokerage account. Currently I have about $17k in stocks or ETFs and the remaining $8k in cash. I'm not going to start day trading until my transfer of $2k goes in so I have $27k and never have to worry about going below $25k again. My plan is to day trade a lot with this Schwab brokerage account and you all are probably aware to do unlimited day trades you need $25k in that single account. I read somewhere recently and I do not know how accurate it was that now you also need $25k in margin to be able to do unlimited day trades? 

Will slapping tight trailing stop losses on all stocks and ETFs affect day trading capabilities for other securities? 

And is there anything I need to be aware of going past the $25k mark and being able to now day trade all the time instead of the 3 allowed in a 5 day period?",0,4,1730565261.0
